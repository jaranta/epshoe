title: Development files for EclipseSHOE now available
---

EclipseSHOE is now open for contributions. The downloadable files can still be found from the master branch, but there is also a devel branch that has all the files the pdfs are converted from.

Since everything is licensed with a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), you can share, use and change the files as you like, as long as you follow the license terms.

Playtests or play reports are still welcome. You send your feedback through the [online form](http://bit.ly/epshoequestions).
