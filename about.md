EclipseSHOE is a combination of the [CC-lisenced](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) role-playing game [Eclipse Phase](http://eclipsephase.com/) and the rule-system [GUMSHOE](http://pelgranepress.com/site/?page_id=672).

The GUMSHOE rules enable players to focus on mysteries and investigations in their games. This rulebook is not a replacement for the Eclipse Phase rulebook. To play Eclipse Phase with these rules, you still need the Eclipse Phase rulebook to look up what the game is about and what kind of themes it deals with.
