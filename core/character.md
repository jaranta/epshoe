# Your Character

Create player characters by choosing your character concept,
investigative abilities, and general abilities.

Investigative abilities allow you to find the information your
character needs to move forward in a mystery-solving narrative,
plus occasional additional benefits.

General abilities help you survive while you’re gathering information
and solving problems. You create characters by spending build
points on your character’s abilities. Each ability has a numerical
rating. Every rating point costs 1 build point to purchase.

The GUMSHOE rules define your character by what he or she can accomplish
in an investigative scenario. The component elements of each
ability don’t matter in rules terms. The rules don’t care if your
Forensic Accounting ability is one part native mental acuity
to two parts training or vice versa, although you can mention
them when describing your character to others. All that matters
is how you solve cases, and overcome other obstacles arising
from them.

Ratings and Pools
-----------------------------------------------

The number you assign to each ability is called a rating. Although
you may improve them gradually over time, ratings remain static
over the course of the typical game session.

For each ability your character has
a pool of points, which fluctuates over the course of each session.
You begin each case, or scenario, with pool points equal to your
rating. You might then immediately spend some of them during
a prelude phase to the investigation itself. You will definitely
spend points as you conduct the investigation. At times your
pool may increase, sometimes refreshing to equal its rating
again.

The distinction between ratings and pools is a crucial one; keep
it in mind as you read and interpret the GUMSHOE rules.

Step One: Concept
---------------------------------------------------

Backgrounds
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first step to creating your character is to choose a background.
Was your character born on Earth before the Fall? Were they raised
on a habitat commune? Or did they start existence as a disembodied
AI?

You must choose one of the backgrounds for your character from
the list below. Choose wisely, as each background may provide
your character with certain characteristics to start with.
Keep in mind that your background is where you came from, not who
you are now. It is the past, whereas your faction represents whom
your character is currently aligned with. Your future, of course,
is yours to make.

The background options presented below cover a wide selection
of transhumanity, but they cannot cover every possibility.
You may work with your Gamemaster to develop a background that
is not included on this list, using these as guidelines to keep
it balanced.

Each Background comes with points in Investigative Abilities,
General Abilities or both. Some Backgrounds come with other
advantages or disadvantages. They also mention common morphs.

## Morphs

Morphs are not of equal value, but are instead paid in General
Ability points. They provide Boosts to some abilities, define
starting Health and some of them have other advantages and disadvantages.

Some morphs provide boosts in one or more Abilities. The effect
of the boost depends on whether the boost is in Investigative
or General Abilities. A boost in an Investigative Ability add
1 to the pool of the Investigative Ability after any points have
been spent from that pool. A boost in a General Ability adds 1 to
the result of any roll in that Ability.

For descriptions of the morphs, see Eclipse Phase rulebook page
139.

## Step Two: Assign Investigative Abilities

Investigative abilities are central to any GUMSHOE character;
they enable you to gather information and drive the plot forward.
The number of points each player spends on investigative abilities
varies according to the number of regularly attending players,
according to the following table. The GM leads the group through
the list of investigative build points, ensuring that each one
of them is covered by at least one member of the group.

Players who can only attend every now and then get the same number
of investigative build points as everyone else, but are not counted
toward the total when deciding how many points to allocate.

----------------------------------------------------------
# of players                 Investigative build points
---------------- -----------------------------------------
 2                                    25

 3                                    19

 4                                    17

 5+                                   16
---------------------------------------------------------

### What Good Are Investigative Ratings?

Players used to the bumbling half-competence of their characters
in other investigative game systems may be surprised to learn
how effective even a single rating point is.

Any rating in an investigative ability indicates a high degree
of professional accomplishment or impressive natural talent.
If you have an ability relevant to the task at hand, you automatically
succeed in discovering any information or overcoming any obstacles
necessary to propel you from the current scene further into the
story.

You may ask to spend points to gain special benefits. Sometimes
the GM will offer you the chance to spend points. In other circumstances
she may accept your  suggestions of
ways to gain special benefits. Use them wisely; spent points
do not return until the next investigation begins.

Once all of the abilities are covered, you are permitted, if you
desire, to reserve any remaining build points to spend as situations
arise during play. You may assign yourself additional abilities,
or increase your ratings in the ones you’ve chosen, as seems appropriate
to your character and the situations she finds herself in. When
you choose to do this, you are not suddenly acquiring abilities
on the spot, but simply revealing for the first time what the character
has been able to do all along.

If you want, you can save build points from character creation
to spend later. If your GM is running an ongoing series, you will
accumulate additional build points during play.

### Investigative Benchmarks

When choosing investigative abilities it is better to get a large
number of abilities with fairly low ratings. Even a 1-point rating
is worth having. You’ll rarely want to spend more than 3 or 4 points
on any one investigative ability.

You must have an investigative ability at a rating of at least
1 to get useful information from it.

### Investigative Abilities

The following abilities are the bread and butter of GUMSHOE characters.

Ability descriptions consist of a brief general description,
followed by examples of their use in an investigation. Creative
players should be able to propose additional uses for their abilities
as unexpected situations confront their characters. Certain
specific actions may overlap between a couple of abilities.

Some abilities, like Research, are broadly useful, and will
crop up constantly. Others may be called for many times in the
course of one scenario, and not at all in others. When building
your character, strike a balance between the reliable workhouse
abilities and their exotic, specialized counterparts.

Investigative abilities are divided into the following sub-groups:
Academic, Interpersonal, Technical and Networking. The purpose
of the sub-groups is to allow you to quickly find the best ability
for the task during play, by scanning the most likely portion
of the overall list.

#### Academic Abilities

##### Archeology

You excavate and study the structures and artifacts of historical
cultures and civilizations. You can:

* tell how long something has been buried

*  identify artifacts by culture and
usage

* distinguish real artifacts from fakes

* navigate inside ruins and catacombs

* describe the customs of ancient or historical cultures

* spot well-disguised graves and underground hiding places

##### Anthropology

You are an expert in the study of human cultures, from the stone
age to the Internet age. You can:

* identify artifacts and rituals of living cultures

* describe the customs of a foreign group or local subculture

* extrapolate the practices of an unknown culture from similar
examples

##### Art

You’re an expert on works of art from an aesthetic and technical
point of view. You can:

* tell when something has been retouched or altered

* call to mind historical details on artists and those around
them

* create works of art

* evaluate the monetary worth of works of art

##### History

You’re an expert in recorded human history, with an emphasis
on its political, military, and economic and technological
developments. You can:

* recognize obscure historical allusions

* recall capsule biographies of famous historical figures

* tell where and when an object made during historical times
was fashioned

* identify the period of an article of dress or costume

##### Languages

For each rating point in Languages, you are verbally fluent and
literate in one language other than your native tongue. You may
specify these when you create your character, or choose opportunistically
in the course of play, revealing that you just happen to speak
Javanese when circumstances require it. You are not learning
the language spontaneously but revealing a hitherto unmentioned
fact about your character. You may elect to be literate in an ancient
language which is no longer spoken.

##### Law

You are familiar with the criminal and civil laws of your home
jurisdiction, and broadly acquainted with foreign legal systems.
At a rating of 2 or more, you are a bar-certified attorney. You
can:

* assess the legal risks attendant on any course of action

* understand lawyerly jargon

* argue with police and prosecutors

##### Medicine

You are an expert in the applied care and maintenance of biological
beings and life. You can:

* conduct physical exams

* diagnose ailments and analyze samples

* perform autopsies

* recognize biotech and use nanotech medical tools

Note that the Medicine cannot be used the heal Health damage during
an investigation. That is covered by the Medic General Ability.

##### Physics

You are an expert in physics ranging from theoretical physics
to material science. You can:

* explain unusual physical phenomena and technologies based
on them

* determine what elements are needed to nanofabricate something

* analyse exotic materials

##### Political Science

You are an expert in the politics of transhumanity. You can:

* name and recognize the most important power-players in transhuman
politics

* name and recognize all of the transhuman factions

* recognize which factions would benefit from some event

##### Xenology

You are an expert in life forms that are not native to Earth. You
can:

* recognize alien races

* recognize alien ruins, architecture and artifacts

* with the help of Biology, analyze alien nanoviruses and plagues

#### Interpersonal Abilities

##### Bureaucracy

You know how to navigate a bureaucratic organization, whether
it’s a governmental office or a large business concern. You know
how to get what you want from it in an expeditious manner, and with
a minimum of ruffled feathers. You can:

* convince officials to provide sensitive information

* gain credentials on false pretenses

* find the person who really knows what’s going on

* locate offices and files

* borrow equipment or supplies

Bureaucracy is not a catch-all information gathering ability.
Bureaucrats wish to convey the impression that they are busy
and harried, whether or not they actually are. Most take a profound,
secret joy in directing inquiries elsewhere. When players attempt
to use Bureaucracy to gain information more easily accessible
via other abilities (such as Research), their contacts snidely
advise them to do their own damn legwork

##### Flattery

You’re good at getting people to help you by complimenting them,
as subtly or blatantly as they prefer. You can get them to:

* reveal information

* perform minor favors

* regard you as trustworthy.

##### Flirting

You’re adept at winning cooperation from people who find you
sexually attractive. You can get them to:

* reveal information

* help you in small ways

* date you

It’s up to you whether a high rating in Flirting means that you
are physically alluring, or simply exude a sexual magnetism
unrelated to your looks.

##### Impersonate

You’re good at posing as another person, whether briefly misrepresenting
yourself during a phone call or spending long periods undercover
in a fictional identity.

Successfully disguising yourself as an actual person known
to those you’re interacting with is extraordinarily difficult.
Brief voice-only mimicry requires a spend of at least 1.

Face-to-face impersonation requires a spend of at least 2 to
3 points for every five minutes of sustained contact between
you and the object of your impersonation. Especially wary or
intelligent subjects cost more to hoodwink than dull-witted
walk-on characters.

##### Interrogation

You’re trained in extracting information from suspects and
witnesses in the context of a formal police-style interview.
This must take place in an official setting, where the subject
is confined or feels under threat of confinement, and recognizes
your authority (whether real or feigned.)

##### Intimidation

You elicit cooperation from suspects by seeming physically
imposing, invading their personal space, and adopting a psychologically
commanding manner. Intimidation may involve implied or direct
threats of physical violence but is just as often an act of mental
dominance. You can:

* gain information

* inspire the subject to leave the area

* quell a subject’s desire to attempt violence against you or
others

##### Kinesics

You can tell when some people are lying. You must usually be interacting
with them or observing them from a close distance, but sometimes
you can spot liars on television, too. Unfortunately, nearly
everyone lies, especially when facing possible trouble from
the authorities. Sometimes you can infer why they’re lying,
but it’s hard to reliably discern motive or get at the facts they’re
working to obscure. This sense doesn’t tell you what they’re
lying about, specifically, or see through their lies to the truth.

Not all lies are verbal. You can tell when a person is attempting
to project a false impression through body language.

Certain individuals may be so adept at lying that they never set
off your bullshit detector. Some people believe their own falsehoods.
Psychopathic personality types lie reflexively and without
shame, depriving you of the telltale tics and gestures you use
to sense when a person is deceiving you. Sometimes you need leverage
to get information out of people who you know are lying – re-interviewing
suspects in the light of additional facts is a genre staple.

##### Negotiation

You are an expert in making deals with others, convincing them
that the best arrangement for you is also the best for them. You
can:

* haggle for goods and services

* mediate hostage situations

* swap favors or information with others

##### Protocol

Protocol is the art of making a good impression in social settings.
This includes keeping up with the latest memes, trends, gossip,
interests and habits of various (sub)cultural groups. You can:

* determine who is the appropriate person to speak to

* impress someone with your grasp of customs

* fit into a specific social/cultural grouping

* negate social gaffes

##### Reassurance

You get people to do what you want by putting them at ease. You can:

* elicit information and minor favors

* allay fear or panic in others

* instill a sense of calm during a crisis

#### Technical Abilities

##### Astronomy

You study celestial objects, including the stars, planets.
You can:

* plot the movement of planets and other celestial objects

* recognize objects in space from sensor readings or descriptions

* name objects in the known space

##### Biology

You are an expert on life forms that are native to Earth. You can:

* identify plants and vegetation

* recognize and know how to handle animals

* understand and analyze biological processes like evolution
and mutation

##### Chemistry

You’re trained in the analysis of chemical substances. You can:

* among a wide variety of other materials, identify drugs, pharmaceuticals,
toxins, and viruses

* match samples of dirt or vegetation from a piece of evidence
to a scene

##### Cryptography

You’re an expert in the making and breaking of codes, from the
simple ciphers of old-school espionage tradecraft to the supercomputer
algorithms of the present day. You can:

* crack spoken and written codes

* use cryptographic tools to crack complex encryptions

* find and recognize data hidden with cryptographic methods

##### Geology

You are an expert on rocks, soils, minerals, and the primordial
history of the planets in the solar system. You can:

* analyze soil samples, crystals, minerals, and so forth

* determine the age of a rock stratum

* date and identify fossils

* evaluate soil for agriculture or industry

* identify promising sites for oil or water wells, mines, etc

* anticipate volcanism, seismic events, avalanches, and other
earth phenomena

##### Engineering

You’re an expert in the principles of designing and building
devices, habitat systems and vehicles. You can:

* spot hidden rooms from floor plans

* find the weak spots in habitat systems

* figure out what it takes to make a space shuttle to break in a
specific way

##### Forgery

You’re an expert in forging credentials, ID’s and security hashes.
Forgery applies both to physical and digital documents. You
can:

* create false identities

* get people through customs

* create plausible looking old records

##### Investigation

You’re adept at finding, bagging and tagging important clues.
You can:

* spot objects of interest at a crime scene or other investigation
site

* note relationships between objects at a crime scene, reconstructing
sequences of events

* store objects for forensic analysis without contaminating
your samples

##### Perception

You’re adept at the use of your physical senses (including cybernetic)
and awareness of the physical world around you. You can:

* notice small details about your surroundings

* spot hidden objects

Note that this skill doesn’t cover investigation of a crime scene.
That is covered by Investigation. This skill also doesn’t cover
spotting ambushes, traps or the like. That is covered by Sense
Trouble.

##### Programming

You’re an expert in algorithms, programs and data. You can:

* understand what a program does based on its code

* find flaws in programs

* design virtual settings

Note that Programming does not cover information security and
hacking. That is covered by Infosec.

##### Research

You are adept at looking up information on the mesh: searching,
sifting, mining, and interpreting data. This includes knowing
where to look, what links to follow, and how to optimize your queries.
You can:

* look up the answer to a question

* find databases

* search archives

* track down anything online

* track somebody with their mesh ID

## Step 3: Assign General Abilities

Each player gets 70 points to spend on general abilities, regardless
of group size.

General abilities use different rules than investigative ones,
which allow for possible failure. They help you survive while
you investigating. When choosing general abilities, you’ll
want to concentrate your points among a few abilities, giving
your comparatively higher ratings than you want in the investigative
category.

You start the game with 4 points in Stability and your starting
Health is determined by the morph you chose.

Although there is no set cap on abilities, the second highest
rating must be at least half that of the highest rating.

### What Good are General Ratings?

General abilities use a different set of rules and are measured
on a different scale than investigative abilities. The two ability
sets are handled in different way because they fulfill distinct
narrative functions. The rules governing general abilities
introduce the possibility of failure into the game, creating
suspense and uncertainty. Uncertain outcomes make scenes of
physical action more exciting, but can stop a mystery story dead
if applied to the collection of information. This division may
seem aesthetically weird when you first encounter it, but as
you grow used to the GUMSHOE system you’ll see that it works.

GUMSHOE focuses not on your character’s innate traits, but on
what they can actually do in the course of a storyline. Why they
can do it is up to each player. Your characters are as strong, fast,
and good-looking as you want them to be.

### General Ability Benchmarks

A rating of 1-3 indicates that the ability is a sideline. 4-7 is
solid but not off the charts. 8 or more suggests a dedicated bad-assery
that will be immediately apparent to observers when they see
you in action.

### 0-Rated General Abilities

If you have a rating of 0 in a general ability, that is you have put
no build points into it, you cannot make a test on that ability.
That is not to say you can't do the thing at
all; it's only if you want to attempt something requiring a roll
that you will not succeed. You character might be able to drive,
but with a Drive rating of 0 you will not be able to deal with a car
chase or potential crash.

### General Abilities as Investigative Abilities

Many General abilities also function as Investigative abilities,
either when used to gather a clue (rather than to overcome opposition)
or to interact with people devoted to those abilities’ use: Melee
Combat, for example, can be used investigatively to infiltrate
a dojo or gymnasium, and to gather information or gossip from
the clientele or managers. When used as Investigative Abilities,
General Abilities don’t require tests, only the use of the ability
and possibly point spends.

### Cherries

Some General abilities have a cherry, a feature that kicks
in when the character has 8 rating points or more in it. Characters
can always use that special benefit, even if their pool in that
ability has dropped to 0.

### General Abilities

This chapter lists all the General Abilities. There are two special categories of General Abilities, Networking Abilities and Psi Sleights. They work slightly differently, but are still purchased with the same points as other General Abilities.

##### Athletics

Athletics allows you to perform general acts of physical derring-do,
from running to jumping to dodging falling or oncoming objects.
Any physical action not covered by another ability, probably
falls under the rubric of Athletics.

*Athletics Cherry:* If your Athletics rating is 8 or more, your Hit Threshold, the
Target Number your opponents use when attempting to hit you in
combat, is 4. Otherwise, your Hit Threshold is 3.

##### Demolitions

You’re an expert in bombs and booby-traps. You can:

* defuse bombs and traps

* reconstruct exploded bombs, determining their materials,
manufacture, and the sophistication of the bomb-maker

* safely construct and detonate explosive devices of your own

*Demolitions Cherry:* If your Demolitions rating is 8 or more, you may spend points from Demolitions to add damage to your bombs. You do this after damage has been rolled and can add 1 point of damage for each 2 points spent.

See [Explosions](#explosions) for more information on how Demolitions works.

##### Ground Craft

You’re a skilled defensive driver, capable of wringing high
performance from even the most recalcitrant ground vehicle.
You can:

* evade or conduct pursuit

* avoid collisions, or minimize damage from collisions

* spot tampering with a vehicle

* conduct emergency repairs

##### Gunnery

You are good at use and maintenance of large, vehicular, or non-portable
weapons systems. Firing these weapons is more like playing a
video game than firing a gun.

##### Hardware

You’re good at building, repairing, and disabling devices,
from atmosphere sensors and ground craft to mainframe computers.
Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices
from odd bits of scrap.

*Hardware Cherry:* If your Hardware rating is 8 or more, you get 1 free rating point in the Investigative ability Engineering.

##### Health

Health measures your ability to sustain injuries, resist infection,
and survive the effects of toxins. When you get hit in the course
of a fight, your Health pool is diminished. A higher Health pool
allows you to stay in a fight longer before succumbing to your
injuries.

When your Health pool is depleted, you may be dazed, wounded,
or pushing up the daisies. For more on this, see “Exhaustion,
Injury and Gruesome Death.”

Your Health depends on the morph you are currently inhabiting.

##### Infiltration

You’re good at placing yourself inside places you have no right
to be. You can:

* pick locks

* deactivate or evade security systems

* move silently

* find suitable places for forced entry, and use them

Despite its name, Infiltration is as useful for getting out of
places undetected as if its for getting into them.

*Infiltration Cherry:* If your Infiltration rating is 8 or more, you can automatically open any standard civilian or commercial lock without a test. Complex, specialized or custom locks always require a test to open.

##### Infosec

You are adept at cracking security systems and bypassing firewalls or stopping them from being cracked. You can:

* bypass authentication

* deactivate, evade or create digital security measures

* create or disable worms, viruses or malware

* throw off security measures tracking you

*Infosec Cherry:* If your Infosec rating is 8 or more, you get 1 free rating point in the Investigative ability Cryptography. You can also encrypt your team’s electronic communications against all but highest level cracking.

##### Medic

You can perform first aid on sick or injured individuals. For
more on the use of this ability, see “Exhaustion, Injury, and
Death.”

*Medic Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Medic, you get 1 point in Medicine.

##### Melee Combat

You can hold your own in a hand-to-hand fight, whether you wish
to kill, knock out, restrain, or evade your opponent.

*Melee Combat Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Melee Combat, you can spend 1 point of Melee Combat to evaluate how others compare to you in skill. The GM tells you whether one other characters rating in Melee Combat is below, within 1 point or above your rating.

##### Palming

Your nimble fingers allow you to unobtrusively manipulate small
objects. You can:

*  pilfer clues from a crime scene under
the very noses of unsuspecting authorities

* pick pockets

* plant objects on unsuspecting subjects

*Palming Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Palming, you can spend points on Palming tests after rolling the die, at the cost of 2 points for 1 point increase in die result.

##### Preparedness

You expertly anticipate the needs of any mission by packing a
kit efficiently arranged with necessary gear. Assuming you
have immediate access to your kit, you can produce whatever object
the team needs to overcome an obstacle. The rules for Preparedness
are defined in the section on Gear.

Other abilities imply the possession of basic gear suitable
to their core tasks. Characters with Medic have their own first
aid kits. If you have Shooting, you have a gun, and so on. Preparedness
does not intrude into their territory. It covers general-purpose
investigative equipment, plus oddball items that suddenly
come in handy in the course of the story.

The sorts of items you can produce at a moment’s notice depend
not on your rating or pool, but on narrative credibility. If the
GM determines that your possession of an item would seem ludicrous
or and/or out of genre, you don’t get to roll for it. You simply
don’t have it. Any item which elicits a laugh from the group when
suggested is probably out of bounds.

Inappropriate use of the Preparedness ability is like pornography.
Your GM will know it when she sees it.

##### Psychosurgery

You are adept at use of machine-aided psychological techniques
to repair, damage, or manipulate the psyche. You can:

* implement behavioral control or masking or emotional control

* conduct deep learning or psychotherapy

* conduct interrogation or psychotorture

* edit personalities

Using Psychosurgery requires specialized facilities and a
willing or constrained patient that is placed in a simulspace
as a digital consciousness.

*Psychosurgery Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Psychosurgery, you get 1 free point in Flattery, Interrogation, Kinesics or Reassurance.

##### Sense Trouble

Keen perceptions allow you to spot signs of potential danger
to yourself and others. Information gained from this ability
might save your skins but doesn’t directly advance the central
mystery. You might use it to:

* hear someone sneak up on you

* see an obscured or hidden figure

* smell a gas leak

* have a bad feeling about this

Players never know the Difficulty Numbers for Sense Trouble before deciding how many points to spend. Players must blindly choose how much to spend.

When more than one player is able to make a Sense Trouble test, the group decides which of them makes the attempt. Only one attempt per source of trouble occurs, conducted by the chosen PC.

*Sense Trouble Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Sense Trouble, you don't need to test for surprise when an opponent tries to surprise you. You don't take any negative modifiers for surprise.

##### Shooting

You’re adept with shooting all kinds of weapons from kinetic
weapons to spray and beam weapons.

*Shooting Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Shooting, you can spend 2 points to shoot to up to twice the normal range of the gun you are using without penalties.

##### Shuttle Craft

You’re adept at flying craft used in and around celestial objects
that have an atmosphere.

##### Space Craft

You’re adept at flying craft used in moving from one part of the
solar system to other parts of it.

##### Stability

Jarring or stressful events can exert a damaging long-term psychological
toll. Your Stability rating indicates your resistance to mental
trauma.

You get Stability 4 for free.

##### Resources

You have material resources at your disposal. This may mean money,
stocks, or any other resource that is easily traded. Resources
can be used to acquire goods and services.

Resources can also be combined, forming a shared Resource rating.

*Resources Cherry:* If you have 8 or more points in Resources, you can try a Resources test with a Difficulty of 2 less once per game session.

### Networking Abilities

There are 7 different networking Abilities, but they all work
in the same manner. Points from rep can be used to get information,
favors or equipment from contacts. Unlike most other General
Abilities, Networking Abilities use a Toll Test and they often
double as Investigative Abilities. See [Using Networking Abilities and
Resources](#networking-and-resources) for more information.

*Networking Cherry:* All Networking Abilities have the same Cherry. You only get it once, regardless of how many of them have at 8 or more points. A character with the Networking Cherry can try a Networking test with a Difficulty of 2 less once per game session.

Networking comes in the following flavors:

##### @-Rep (Autonomists)

Network Name: The Circle-A List

Networking Field: Autonomists

Covers: anarchists, Barsoomians, Extropians, Titanian, and
scum

##### C-Rep (Hypercorps)

Network Name: CivicNet

Networking Field: Hypercorps

Covers: hypercorps, Jovians, Lunars, Martians, Venusians

##### E-Rep (Ecologists)

Network Name: EcoWave

##### F-Rep (Media)

Network Name: Fame

Networking Field: Media

Covers: socialites (also artists, glitterati, and media)

##### G-Rep (Criminals)

Network Name: Guanxi

Networking Field: Criminals

##### I-Rep (Firewall)

Network Name: The Eye

Networking Field: Firewall

Covers: Firewall

I-rep is only available to characters that belong to the Firewall.

##### R-Rep (Scientists)

Network Name: Research Network Associates

Networking Field: Scientists

Covers: argonauts (also technologists, researchers, and scientists)

### Psi Sleights

It costs 5 build points to gain a rating of 1 in any Psi Sleight and
1 build point for each additional build point after 1.

Purchasing Psi Sleights means that
your character is infected with the Watts-MacLeod strain of
the exsurgent virus. See the [Psi rules](#psi) section for more information.

There are several forms of different Psi Sleights:

##### Pattern Recognition

You’re adept at recognizing patterns. You can:

* Substitute Pattern Recognition to Language, Investigation,
Research or Programming when the task is about recognizing
patterns.

##### Charisma

You can influence the target’s mind on a subconscious level to
appear charming, magnetic and persuasive. You can:

* Substitute Charisma to Flattery, Flirting, Negotiation
or Reassurance.

##### Cloud Memory

You can temporarily disrupt the target’s ability to form long-term
memories, if you succeed in a Test. The Tests difficulty is normally
4, but might be higher for exceptionally strong-willed individuals.
Cloud Memory affects the target for one scene.

##### Deep Scan

You can telepathically invade the target’s mind and probe it
for information, if you succeed in a Test. The Tests difficulty
is normally 4, but might be higher for exceptionally strong-willed
individuals. For every point you succeeded over the difficulty
you get to ask the gamemaster one yes/no-question. The target
is aware that their mind is being probed.

##### Ego Sense

You can detect the presence and location of other sentient and
biological life forms (i.e., egos) within a short range. You
have a rough idea of the size, type of creature, and distance of
the egos. The result of your test determines what the range of
Ego Sense is:

* Result 4: every ego within 5 meters.

* Result 6: every ego within 10 meters.

* Result 8: every ego within 15 meters.

* Result 10: every ego within 20 meters.

##### Mindlink

You can communicate with others telepathically. Mindlink costs
1 point per target to use. You must succeed in a Difficulty 4 test
against unwilling targets.

##### Psychic Stab

You can use Psi to attack others. You must succeed in a test against
the target’s Hit Threshold to do Damage +0 against them. Psychic
Stab ignores armor.

## Starting Gear

Every character starts off free with a standard muse and 1 month
of backup insurance at no cost.

Other gear needs not to be defined before it is needed in the game,
with Preparedness working as the description of how well equipped
a character is.

You can also assume that characters own the basic gear needed
to use their Abilities. What this means for each Ability is up
to player interpretation. For example, this doesn't mean that
all characters with Demolitions have bombs in their pockets,
but that they have access to bomb disposal and installation equipment.

Augmentations for starting morphs are handled a bit differently: players 
receive a special pool for personal augmentations equal to their Resources
or Preparedness, whichever is higher. They can use this pool to test
for having augmentations on their starting morph at any point in
the game. To test for augmentations they must use at least 1 point
from that pool. Points can never be added to this pool. Players
have a chance of returning any unused points to their pool whenever
they change morphs -- if they do not, the points are lost. Any 
further augmentations for morphs should be acquired as described
in [the rules for gear](#gear).

## Motivations

Each PC follows motivations, giving him, her or it good reason
to act heroically and curiously. By following your motivations,
you keep the story moving and ensure that your behavior is in keeping
with the science-fiction horror genre.

These are memes, in the form of ideologies or goals, which your
character is pursuing. These may be as specific as “undermine
the local triad boss” or as broad as “promote hypercapitalism,”
and they may be short term or long term.

Motivations should be listed on your character sheet as a single
term or short phrase, along with a + or – symbol to denote whether
they support or oppose it. For example, **+Fame** would indicate
that your character seeks to become a famous media personality,
whereas **–Reclaim Earth** means that your character opposes
the goal of reclaiming Earth.

Choose 3 motivations for your character. Motivations should
reflect both the character and the game. Choosing **+Fame**
in a campaign that is about uplift rights may or may not be appropriate.
Motivations should be discussed both with the GM and the other
players.
