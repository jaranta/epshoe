# Introduction

This is an adaptation of Eclipse Phase to the GUMSHOE rules system. The GUMSHOE rules enable players to focus on mysteries and investigations in their games. This rulebook is not a replacement for the Eclipse Phase rulebook. To play Eclipse Phase with these rules, you still need the Eclipse Phase rulebook to look up what the game is about and what kind of themes it deals with.

With this book you can:

1. Create characters using the GUMSHOE system. (The Eclipse Phase rulebook is still necessary for the background information.)
2. Play or design investigative scenarios, where the focus is not on whether the characters find the information, but on how they use it.

If you are not familiar with Eclipse Phase, I suggest you take a look at it at this point. It is easily available online both freely and purchased. If you already know about Firewall and existential risks, you can try creating some characters.
