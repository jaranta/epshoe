# Designing Scenarios

The GUMSHOE system supports a certain style of scenario design.
The rules are less important to the success of your game than the
way you structure your adventures.

## Clues

If a piece of information is essential to move the story on, it’s
a core clue. It costs nothing. You can also offer minor tidbits
of information at a 0 points, if the information not consequential
enough to be worth a point spend.

If you have a piece of information that
offers a fun sidelight on the action but is not essential to move
through the story, you can make this available with a 1- or 2-point
spend. Choose the cost of the spend according to the entertainment
value of the information, not the game-world difficulty of completing
the task. The whole point of the system is to make clues easy to
acquire, so that players can get on with the fun of figuring out
how they fit together. Facilitate this by making choices that
get information into the hands of players. Habits die hard, so
make sure you’re not slipping back into the old paradigm and making
the clues hard to get.

If an action’s consequence of failure might be madness, death
or injury, by all means make it a test. If game world logic suggests
that a supporting character will actively oppose the PC, make
it a contest.

### Clue Types

Special clue types are as follows.

#### Floating Core Clues

It can be useful to structure a scenario with one or more free-floating
core clues. These typically advance the story from one distinct
section to another. Where an ordinary core clue is linked with
a particular scene, a floating clue can be gleaned in any one of
several scenes. The GM determines during play which scene gives
up the clue.

Floating clues allow you to control the pacing of a scenario.
They allow the characters to play out all of the fun or interesting
experiences in one section of the scenario before the story takes
a dramatic turn. For example, you might want them to separately
meet all of the suspects before they, and the Investigators,
get locked up for the night in an old dark house. To achieve this,
withhold the core clue that moves the investigators to the dark
house until after they’ve met all of the relevant supporting
characters. That way, you prevent them from leaping ahead into
the narrative without getting all the information they need
to fully enjoy what follows.

Likewise, a floating clue allows you to perform like a ruthless
editor, skipping unnecessary scenes when you need to kick the
narrative into a higher gear. Let’s say you’ve chosen five possible
scenes in which the Investigators might logically get a necessary
core clue. You figure that this phase of the adventure should
take about an hour. If the players breeze through the scenes in
ten minutes apiece, you can save the core clue for the last scene.
If they linger, taking twenty minutes per scene, you’ll want
to make the core clue available after the third scene.

Player frustration level usually serves as a better trigger
for a floating core clue than a predetermined time limit. If they’re
having obvious fun interacting with the vivid supporting characters
you’ve created, or being creeped out by uncanny phenomena, you
can give them more of what they want by saving the core clue for
the final scene. On the other hand,
if you see they’re getting bored and frustrated, you can slip
in the floating clue earlier.

#### Leveraged Clues

A staple element of mystery writing is the crucial fact which,
when presented to a previously resistant witness or suspect,
causes him to break down and suddenly supply the information
or confession the detectives seek. This is represented in GUMSHOE
by the leveraged clue. This is a piece of information which is
only available from the combined use of an interpersonal ability,
and the mention of another, previously gathered clue. The cited
clue is called a prerequisite clue, and is by definition a sub-category
of core clue.

#### Pipe Clues

A clue which is important to the solution of the mystery, but which
becomes significant much later in the scenario, is called a pipe
clue. The name is a reference to screenwriting jargon, where
the insertion of exposition that becomes relevant later in the
narrative is referred to as “laying pipe.” The term likens the
careful arrangement of narrative information to the work performed
by a plumber in building a house.

Pipe clues create a sense of structural variety in a scenario,
lessening the sense that the PCs are being led in a strictly linear
manner from Scene A to Scene B to Scene C. When they work well, they
give players a “eureka” moment, as they suddenly piece together
disparate pieces of the puzzle. A possible risk with pipe clues
lies in the possible weakness of player memories, especially
over the course of a scenario broken into several sessions. The
GM may occasionally have to prompt players to remember the first
piece of a pipe clue when they encounter a later component.

#### Restricted Clues

Certain clues which are necessary to the solution of a mystery
will not be known to everyone with the ability required to access
them. Instead, these are restricted clues—secret, esoteric
or otherwise obscure facts which one member of the group just
happens to know.

Only a select few people know about OPERATION CORNWALLIS, but
if it is necessary to the completion of an investigation, an investigator
will be one of them.

To preserve the sense that the group has access to little-known
facts, only one group member knows the information in question;
its revelation comes as news to all of the other investigators,
even those who have the same ability. The first character with
the relevant ability to take an action that might trigger the
clue is the one blessed with this fortuitous knowledge. Where
no clear first actor exists, as in a clue provided as soon as the
investigators enter a scene, the GM chooses the investigator
with the highest current pool in that ability (if applicable)
or the investigator who has had the least recent spotlight time
or most requires a positive  reversal
of fortune. Alternately, the GM may allow applicable background
considerations to determine the possessor of the restricted
clue: for example, a character with high Bureaucracy might recognize
a suspect from back office work.

### Timed Results

The following structural technique applies to any GUMSHOE game
where the characters have access to the services of a forensic
lab, and rely on tests performed by others.

You can shape the pacing of a case with a timed result. This occurs
when believability requires a suitable interval between the
submission of evidence to forensic experts and the results of
the testing they perform. In police procedurals, it is common
for the direction of an investigation to be suddenly changed
when the lab results come in. The scientific evidence may exonerate
the current top suspect or point the investigators toward new
witnesses or locations. Alternately, it can change the meaning
of previously gleaned information, causing the investigators
to conduct re-interview previous witnesses, or conduct closer
searches of crime scenes.

A timed result can serve as a delayed-reaction core clue, directing
the PCs to a new scene. These are useful devices in cases where
the scenes can be connected in any order. If the PCs get bored or
bogged down in one scene, they can receive a phone call from the
lab techs calling them in to receive some much-needed exposition,
which sends them in a new direction.

The arrival of a timed result can also change the players’ interpretation
of their current case notes without moving them to a new scene.
They might dismiss a suspect’s alibi, alter their timeline of
events, or reject information provided them by a witness whose
perceptions are revealed as unreliable.

News of a lab report requiring the team’s attention can also be
used to cut short a scene that the players won’t abandon, even
though they’ve already collected all available clues.

### Records are your Friend

In addition to your adventure notes, there are two other documents
you need to run the game.

When you are creating your adventure, make a note of the investigative
abilities you’ve used on the Investigative Ability Checklist.
It’s a good idea to add clues for as wide a range of abilities as
possible. You can also use the Checklist during character creation
to ensure all the abilities are covered, and that redundant abilities
are left out.

Secondly, during character creation, have your players note
their choices of investigative abilities on the GM’s Investigator
Roster. This enables you to pick out
which characters might notice obvious clues, and ensure spotlight
time is evenly spread.

When you prepare your next session, you can use the Investigator
Roster to see what interests your players. If someone has a 3-point
rating in Art, you could add a some forged artwork or a menacing
sculpture to your notes. This is particularly useful in an improvised
game.

## Scene Types

Having planned out your mystery, it’s time to arrange it into
scenes. Each of these takes place in a different location or involves
an interaction with a different supporting character—usually
both. Under the title of the scene, write the scene type, and the
scene or scenes which lead to the current scene, and scenes which
lead from it. Here is an example scene header from the introductory
adventure.

>###The Good Reverend

>Scene Type: Core

>Lead-In: The Briefing

>Lead-Outs: The Visionary, The Skeptic, Newshounds of Sequoia
City

>Scenes fall into the following types.

### Introductory

This is the first scene of the episode. It establishes the premise
of the mystery. If it’s the characters’ first meeting, have the
agents first rendezvous with one another. Then, they meet Mr.
Verity in a second secure locale where you provide the briefing
and answer questions. When sent to deal with an emergency already
in, they go direct to the scene and are briefed there by Mr. Verity.
You can extend this scene if it’s your first session of the Esoterrorists.
See the Introductory scene in Operation Prophet Bunco.

### Core

Core scenes present at least one piece of information necessary
to complete the investigation and get to the climactic scene.

Each core scene requires at least a single core clue.

A core clue typically points the group to another scene, often
a core scene.

Avoid hard sequenced core clues, which can only lead to one another
in a single order.

You’re constructing one way to move through the story to another
core clue, not the only way. In play, you may find yourself placing
the core clue from one scene in another, improvised scene inspired
by the logical actions undertaken by the players.
(This is also true of published scenarios, by the way.) The scene
structure guarantees that there’s at least one way to navigate
the story, but should not preclude other scene orders. By following
the structure you also ensure that you’re creating a branching
narrative driven by player choices. This avoids the syndrome
of the story driven by the actions of supporting characters,
which the players observe more or less passively.

> ### Placing Information

> A core scene typically includes many pieces of information in
addition to its core clue. Facts may provide understanding and
context. Or they may obscure the mystery, by focusing attention
on irrelevant details. Creating a scene is about anticipating
the questions the players will ask and figuring out which answers
ought to be available to the investigative experts their characters
happen to be.

> Don’t make all non-core clues spends. Add spends when:

> * you think of facts that seem enjoyably arcane

> * a piece of information is tangential or obscure

> * the players might get information more quickly than they otherwise
would

> * they might secure some other practical advantage

> If a spend doesn’t make the character giving up his points seem
more impressive, or confer some other advantage, it shouldn’t
be a spend.

### Alternate

Alternate scenes provide information which may be of some use
in understanding and solving the central mystery, but aren’t
strictly necessary to reach the conclusion. They often provide
context and detail. Or they might provide the same information
as core scenes, but in another way. As a third option, they might
allow the group to eliminate a red herring possibility. These
exculpatory facts are valuable; they let the lasers narrow their
search to the real answer, even though they don’t strictly speaking,
lead to another core clue.

### Antagonist Reaction

This is a scene of danger or trouble in which supporting characters
opposed to the group’s success take action to stop them or set
them back. This might be a fight scene, but could just as easily
be a political hassle, act of sabotage, or other less direct challenge.
If it helps you keep track, you might note in brackets that the
enemies faced are tangential rather than primary opponents.
Antagonist reactions can be floating, that is, you can use them
to kick up the pace if things are flagging.

### Hazard

A hazard scene presents the crew with an impersonal obstacle
to their safety or ability to continue the investigation. It
must typically be overcome through tests or contests.

### Sub-Plot

A sub-plot scene gives the characters an opportunity to wheel,
deal, explore and interact without directly altering the course
of the investigation. These may arise from personal arcs, side
deals, public relations efforts, or simply the curiosity of
one or more agents. Where the central mystery provides structure
and forward momentum, the sub-plot adds flavor and character.
Sequences arising from it may be what the group remembers long
after the mystery has been put to bed. Sub-plots are more suited
to long-running campaign play.

### Conclusion

The conclusion brings the group to the end of its investigation
and often confronts it with a moral dilemma, physical obstacle,
or both. Functionally, it’s a final hazard or antagonist reaction
scene, although it may be initiated by the players busting in
on esoterrorists or ODEs. The classic conclusion of an RPG mystery
is a big fight. Your group may insist on a climactic scrap, or prefer
to avoid it through quick talking and clever thinking. It’s easy
to make a fight or other action scene feel exciting and conclusive.
In The Esoterrorists conclusions tend to be gory and sanity-threatening.

### Hybrid Scenes

Some scenes double up, most often when a general challenge leads
to an information opportunity. It’s okay to give out a core clue
as a reward for overcoming an obstacle only if that core clue is
also available by other means. Otherwise you risk creating a
situation where a core clue becomes unavailable, violating
the central tenet of the GUMSHOE system.

> ### Scene Diagrams

> To check that player choice matters in your scenario, diagram
its scenes. Connect them with arrows, checking to make sure that
they can be unraveled in any order. It’s acceptable to add unpredictability
and variance with non-investigative scenes (antagonist reactions,
hazards, and sub-plots), but better form when the players can
connect the core and alternate scenes in more than one way.

## Activating Players

A common complaint about investigative scenarios is that they
“railroad” players into tightly following a slavishly predetermined
story path. Although you rarely see the opposite complaint voiced,
a significant number of groups flail in confusion when not steered
in an obvious direction.

Let players weigh options for as long as the discussion seems
lively and fun. If you see the group get frustrated and unable
to make a collective choice, gently insert yourself into the
discussion. Summarize the various suggestions made and direct
the discussion toward a conclusion. Guide the players in eliminating
choices without nudging them to a preferred answer. This detachment
is easier to attain when you don’t settle on one.

Remind the players that the only way
forward in a mystery scenario is to gather more information.
When things get static, refer to the characters’ drives. Ask
them which choices before them most suit their specific drives.

Be ready for moments where players feel overwhelmed, either
because there are too many choices to choose between or, more
likely, no obviously risk-free choice. Nudge them onward by
invoking their drives. Remind them that they’ve been trained
by the OV as problem-solvers. Perhaps unlike the players, the
characters are used to forming hypotheses, testing them by gathering
information, and revising their theories, and moving forward.
They respond to dilemmas by breaking them down into steps. With
a little coaching, they’ll quickly internalize this problem-
solving methodology. Your players will learn to take the initiative,
abandoning the “wait for clues” passivity trained into them
as they were run through more predetermined scenarios.

### Avoid Negation

When running a mystery scenario, it helps to think two or three
scenes ahead of the players. It’s often useful to have a possible
climactic sequence in mind, too. That allows you to foreshadow
enough to make the ending appear to be a logical outgrowth of the
scenes that preceded it. (For more on this, see the next section.)

Don’t let the possible plot forks you have in mind become too fixed
in your imagination. Instead, keep them provisional, so that
you can turn away from them and substitute new choices more in
keeping with player input.

This is a long-winded way of restating the basic principle of
improvisation used by stage actors: never negate. If, as a sketch
unfolds, one performer identifies the other as his mother, the
second performer must embrace and build on that choice. To simply
swat down the choice and say, “I’m not your mother,” is extremely
poor form. It stops the story dead and punishes the other participant
for attempting to advance it.

In a like vein, train yourself to respond to unexpected possibilities
by embracing them and building them into the ongoing storyline.
You may have decided that the pathologist Elsa Hower is an innocent
dupe in an esoterror scheme which requires fresh corpses. However,
the players heavily invest themselves in seeing her as a villain,
you might consider setting aside that planned revelation, so
they can feel a sense of unmitigated triumph when they bring her
to justice.

You don’t have to accept every piece of player direction at face
value. Keep the story surprising by building twists onto the
elements you do incorporate. When in doubt, make the player half-right.
Perhaps Elsa has been parasitized by an ODE which can be extracted
and subjected to an emotionally satisfying comeuppance, allowing
the team to both save an innocent and punish the guilty.

It’s not necessary to turn the narrative
on a dime with every piece of player input. The key is to avoid a
scene in which nothing happens, or in which your scene is less
interesting than the one suggested by the player. When a player
says that the computer archive in the ruined citadel must have
a holographic librarian, it’s a disappointing to rule it out,
or prevent the players from finding it because they haven’t the
right skill to spend from. Extracting useful information from
a holo-character is more fun, and more plot-advancing, than
not. This doesn’t mean, however, that there the program shouldn’t
afterwards spring a nasty surprise on them.

### Leading and Following

Improvising is a technique, not an ultimate goal. Occasionally
you’ll find that it’s more entertaining for all involved if you
seize the narrative reins and steer them in a particular direction.
This will tend to happen more near the end of a scenario, when you’re
trying to wrap all of the threads together into a coherent and
satisfying conclusion.

Again this is a matter of responding to the mood and attitude of
the players. When they’re actively engaged in the story and throwing
out fun suggestions, follow their lead. When their creativity
hits the wall, pick up the slack. Improvisation is an organic
process of give and take.

## Running Scenarios

The GUMSHOE Rules System covers much of what you need to run EclipseSHOE; this section supplements that with additional GM-centric advice.

### Giving Out Clues

To give out information, the PC needs to be in the right place,
with the right ability, and use that ability. This section deals
with each of these preconditions. In short though, whatever
you’ve done in other games, you should always err on the side of
giving out information, not holding it back.

### Having the Right Ability

The rules offer a number of way to call on abilities, depending
on the situation. Choosing the right way to call on an ability
is crucial to the forward momentum of your investigative plot.
Make this choice according to the consequences of failure.

If the consequence of failure is that a character fails to get
a piece of crucial information, success should be automatic
provided that the character has the ability in question, and
the player thinks to ask for it. However, any credible attempt
to get information that would yield a given clue yields that clue,
whether or not this is the ability you’ve specified in the scenario.

(Even at that, you may need to improvise
during play if no player steps up to claim the needed clue, bending
the details of the scenario so that the same information can be
garnered with a different ability, possibly by another player.)

### Using the Right Ability

You can give out clues both actively and passively. By default,
though, GUMSHOE assumes that the use of interpersonal abilities
is active; the players have to correctly choose an appropriate
ability and describe how they’re using it to open a contact up
to questioning. When you see that players are hesitant, tell
the player with the relevant ability that his experienced OV
character can sense that it will work here:

* “You get the feeling that this guy will crack if you lean on him
a little.” (Intimidation)

* “He seems kind of smitten by you.” (Flattery)

* “Offering them tea would be customary here.“ (Protocol)

### Being in the Right Place

GUMSHOE procedural series require their own conceits in order
to keep the story moving in an entertaining manner. They require
the audience’s complicity in looking the other way. Here GM and
players handwave certain elements that break the rules of realism
in order to keep the game running smoothly, just as TV scriptwriters.
For example, the conceit of primacy in shows such as Law and Order
ensure that the lead characters get the juiciest cases and more
action than any cop is likely to experience in a lifetime. Just
as the aforementioned devices arise from the requirements of
TV drama, GUMSHOE’s conceits grapple with the limitations of
a roleplaying session.

The major device you’ll want to adopt, needed for all but the smallest
groups, is the conceit of elastic participation

Use the concept of elastic participation to ensure that there
is always a PC in the right place.

GUMSHOE works best when you assume that everyone is kind-of sort-of
along for every scene—without squinting too hard at any resulting
logic or staging absurdities.

### Rolling for Clues and the GUMSHOE Style

Just as in games where you roll for clues, players always have
to describe a logical course of action that might lead to their
getting information, directly or indirectly suggesting the
ability you use to get it. In the traditional model, there’s a
roll; you supply the information on a success. In GUMSHOE, this
step is skipped—but it’s the only step skipped.

Traditional style:

Player: I examine the body looking
for a cause of death .

GM: Roll Medicine

Player: I succeed.

GM: It’s blunt force trauma to the back of the skull. There are
traces of a slimy residue

GUMSHOE style:

Player: I examine the body looking for a cause of death.

GM: [Checks worksheet to see if the player’s character has Medicine,
which she does.] It’s blunt force trauma to the back of the skull.
There are traces of a slimy residue.

In neither style do you see players grabbing their character
sheets as soon as they enter a new scene and shouting out “Anthropology!
Archaeology! Art! Notice!” They don’t
do this because it would be weird, boring, and stupid—and because
in neither case does it fill all the requirements necessary to
get information from a scene.

The only difference between GUMSHOE and those systems is the
lack of a die roll. You know your group. Give out information in
the same way you would usually give out information, actively,
passively: GUMSHOE doesn’t care. Your players will solicit
it, or you will give it our, just as you always do. There will be
a strong effect on your gaming, but from a subtle change.

### Ending Scenes

In a novel or TV episode, writers can freely cut to the next scene
when their characters have acquired all of the clues available
in the current one. The characters might stick around for hours
tying up loose ends and pursuing fruitless questions, but this
doesn’t happen on screen. We, the audience, are not forced to
sit through such sequences.

This kind of concise editing isn’t so easy in the roleplaying
medium. Players don’t know when they’ve got all the clues.

Here’s a simple trick to gently steer them onwards, without unduly
breaking the illusion of fictional reality:

Before play, take an index card and write on it, in big block letters,
the word SCENE. As soon as the players have gleaned the core clue
and most or all of the secondary clues in a scene, and the action
begins to drag, hold up the card. When the players see this, they
know to move on. (Of course, you have to explain the cue to them
before play begins.) Easy, efficient,
yet somehow not nearly as disruptive or jarring as a verbal instruction.

Even better, use one of the musical stings available from the
Pelgrane Press website for just this purpose.
