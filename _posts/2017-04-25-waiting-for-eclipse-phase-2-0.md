title: Waiting for Eclipse Phase 2.0
---
You might have noticed that [Posthuman Studios is working on Eclipse Phase 2.0](http://eclipsephase.com/eclipse-phase-second-edition-be-released-2017) and is about to publish it in 2017.

What does this mean for EclipseSHOE?

It means that EclipseSHOE is going to continue playtests with the current rules and there will probably be no updates on the rules before Eclipse Phase 2.0 is released. When that happens, I will examine what direction the game is going in and see what changes could be brought over to EclipseSHOE. For example, the skill list is probably useful in rethinking what skills are needed in EclipseSHOE.

And the new resleeving rules look especially interesting.
