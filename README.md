#How to Use These Files
You've received 3 or 4 files: this guide, the beta rules, a character sheet and possibly the rulebook for Eclipse Phase.
The other files are hopefully self-explanatory, but unfortunately the beta rules are currently written in a way that makes the Eclipse Phase rulebook necessary. You need either a working knowledge of the Eclipse Phase universe or the rulebook to make sense of what the game is about. However, it should not be necessary to read the rules part of Eclipse Phase to play the beta game, only the parts that describe how the world works. If you haven't played Eclipse Phase, I actually discourage reading the rules â€“ not because I don't like them, but because I want feedback on how my game stands on it's own. The rulebook for Eclipse Phase is provided under the Creative Commons-license, so you are free to distribute it. If you like the game, I suggest you buy it. The beta rules you have received are also licensed under Creative Commons, but I ask that you do not distribute the files further since the game is still in closed beta. Encountering the game before it is finished could lead to negative experiences, if you haven't actually agreed to play-test it.
##How to Give Feedback
I'm hoping that you will give me feedback of the game. I'll give some suggestions on how to do this, so that the information I get from different groups is fairly comparable.
###1) Have you played Eclipse Phase before?
Just a simple yes or no, with some indication on how much if the answer is positive.
###2) How long did you play the game?
How many sessions did you play? Can you give an estimate of how many hours you played? How long did it take for you to create characters?
###3) Describe what happened in the game
Please give a description of the events in the game, focusing on the elements that were somehow affected by the rules. This can be as detailed as you feel writing or very simple.
###4) Were there any rules you had trouble understanding?
Any language you had trouble understanding? Trouble seeing how different parts of rules work together? Anything else that was unclear? If you had to make interpretations on how some parts of the rules work, can you elaborate what the decision was?
###5) Was there any part of the game that you thought didn't work?
Any rules that you didn't like? Any rules that outright broke when you used them? Were some of the numbers for statistics off? Was there too much or too little of something?
###6) Was there something in the game that you found particularly awesome?
Favorite parts in rules or text? Something you would definitely not cut out?
