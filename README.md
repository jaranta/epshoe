EclipseSHOE is a combination of the [CC-lisenced](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) role-playing game Eclipse Phase and the rule-system GUMSHOE.

# Version
The current version of EclipseSHOE is 0.5. It is fully playable, but requires knowledge of Eclipse Phase.

# Contributing
You can contribute by playtesting, commenting and giving [feedback](http://bit.ly/epshoequestions).

The project is written in the [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) variant of [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and is converted from markdown to pdf using pandoc.

You can create the files yourself by using the makefiles in the `core` and `scenarios` folders -- just use type *make* in the appropriate folder on the command line. It requires the following things installed:

* `make` or `winmake`
* `pandoc`
* some `latex` distribution
