# The GUMSHOE Rules System

This section describes the basic GUMSHOE rules system and is
addressed to players and GM alike. But first bear with us for a
little explanatory theory.

## Why This Game Exists

GUMSHOE speeds and streamlines the time-honored form of the
investigative roleplaying game. The central question a traditional
RPG asks is:

> Will the heroes get the information they need?

Assuming that they look in the right place and apply appropriate
abilities to the task, GUMSHOE ensures that the heroes get the
basic clues they need to move through the story. The question
it asks is:

> What will the heroes do with the information once they’ve got
it?

If you think about it, this is how the source materials we base
our mystery scenarios on handle clues. You don’t see the forensic
techies on CSI failing to successfully use their lab equipment,
or Sherlock Holmes stymied and unable to move forward because
he blew his Zoology roll.

You don’t see this because, in a story failure to gain information
is rarely more interesting than getting it. New information
opens up new narrative possibilities,
new choices and actions for the characters. Failure to get information
is a null result that takes you nowhere.

In a fictional procedural, whether it’s a mystery novel or an
episode of a cop show, the emphasis isn’t on finding the clues
in the first place. When it really matters, you may get a paragraph
telling you how difficult the search was, or a montage of a CSI
team tossing an apartment. But the action really starts after
the clues are gathered.

**Investigative scenarios are not about finding clues, they’re
about interpreting the clues you do find.**

GUMSHOE, therefore, makes the finding of clues all but automatic,
as long as you get to the right place in the story and have the right
ability. That’s when the fun part begins, when the players try
to put the components of the puzzle together.

That’s hard enough for a group of armchair detectives, without
withholding half the pieces from them. Every investigative
scenario begins with a crime or conspiracy committed by a group
of antagonists. The bad guys do something bad. The player characters
must figure out who did it and put a stop to their activities.

When you do see information withheld from characters, it’s seldom
portrayed as a failure on the part of the competent, fact-gathering
heroes. Instead the writers show an external force preventing
them from applying their abilities. In a space opera show, you
might get the proverbial ion storm that prevents the crew from
scanning the planet before they go down. Information is only
withheld when it makes the story more interesting—usually by
placing the heroes at a handicap while they move forward in the
storyline. In GUMSHOE terms, they’re not trying to get an available
clue and failing; they’re using an ability for which no clue is
available.

Historically, story-based roleplaying, of which investigative
games were an early if not the earliest example, evolved from
dungeon-bashing campaigns. They treat clues the same way that
dungeon games treat treasure. You have to search for the clue
that takes you on to the next scene. If you roll well, you get the
clue. If not, you don’t—and the story grinds to a halt.

However, treasure gathering isn’t the main event in a dungeon
game. There, the central activity is killing the monsters and
enemies who live in the dungeon. The treasure-finding phase
comes afterwards, as a mere reward. If you don’t get all the treasure
in a room, you lose out a bit, but the story keeps going, as you tromp
down the hallway to the next monster-filled chamber.

Imagine a dungeon game where you always had to roll well to find
another room to plunder, or sit around feeling frustrated and
bored.

Many of our favorite roleplaying games use the traditional roll-to-get-a-clue
model. You may have been lucky enough to play in them without ever
seeing your game ground to a halt after a failed information roll.
Perhaps your GM, or the scenario  designer,
has carefully crafted the adventure so that you never have to
get any specific clue to advance the story.

More likely, your GM adjusts on the fly to your failed rolls, creating
elaborate workarounds that get you the same information by different
means. When you think about it, these runarounds moments are
essentially time killers. They bring about a predetermined,
necessary result while giving you the illusion of randomness
and chance. GUMSHOE cuts out these filler moments in favor of
scenes that actually advance the story. With the time saved,
you can construct more detailed, compelling mysteries for the
players to sort out. That’s where the streamlining comes in.

If you’ve never had a game stop dead on a missed clue, you may naturally
figure that it never happens to anyone. Having run GMing seminars
at conventions for years, I can assure you that this is not the
case. People come up to me all the time to share their horror stories
of games that literally go nowhere on a blown spot test. This should
not be surprising. GMs are doing what the rules tell them to do,
and failing to see the unwritten rule that they should then spend
five to twenty minutes of game time introducing a workaround.

GUMSHOE gives you the rules you should actually use as written,
and skips the workaround.

But even if you’ve never noticed this problem, play it because
it focuses and streamlines play, eliminating the elaborate
workarounds your GM has to use to make the missed information
rolls invisible to you. It replaces these moments of circular
plotting with more interesting scenes that move the story forward.

## Mystery Structure

Every investigative scenario begins with a crime, conspiracy,
or other act of disorder committed by a group of antagonists.
The bad guys do something bad. The player characters must figure
out who did it and put a stop to their activities.

Your GM designs each scenario by creating an investigation trigger,
a sinister conspiracy, and a trail of clues.

The investigation trigger. This is the event, that attracts
the attention of investigators.

* The discovery of a murder victim, obviously slain during a
ritualistic killing.

* The discovery of a corpse slain by supernatural means, perhaps
by a creature.

* Sightings of supernatural creatures or phenomena.

The sinister conspiracy. This sets out who the bad guys are, what
they’ve done so far, what they’re trying to do, and how the investigation
trigger fits into the overall scheme. The GM also determines
what has to happen to prevent the plot from going
forward. This, unknown to the players, is their victory condition
— what they have to do to thwart the bad guys and bring the story
to a positive conclusion.

Once the GM has the logic of the story worked out from the villain’s
point of view, she then thinks in reverse, designing a trail of
clues leading from the investigation trigger to an understanding
of the sinister plot and its players, sufficient to get to work
destroying it.

Optionally, the GM may also plan a series of antagonist reactions.
These lay out what the bad guys do when they find out that they’re
being investigated. The GM determines what conditions trigger
them, and what the antagonists attempt to do. These may include
further crimes, giving the team more to investigate. They may
try to destroy evidence, hinder the investigation by planting
false leads, or to intimidate or dispose of potential witnesses,
including accomplices they no longer trust. They may attack
the investigators. Foolish, overconfident or risk-taking
antagonists may take them on directly. Clever antagonists will
strike from a distance, taking great pains to cover their tracks.

Ordinary crime dramas may call for a simpler structure. The bad
guys could still be furthering a sinister plot, or they may be
doing nothing after committing the triggering crime other than
hoping that the investigators don’t catch up with them. In this
case there is no ongoing conspiracy to disrupt. To achieve victory
and bring the scenario to a successful conclusion, the investigators
need merely prove their case against the criminals. The climactic
scene might involve wringing a confession from the wrongdoer,
or provoking him into revealing the crucial bit of evidence which
will ensure his conviction.

## From Structure To Story

The GM’s structure notes are not a story. The story occurs as you,
the team of players, brings the structure to life through the
actions of your characters. The story proceeds from scene to
scene, where you determine the pace, discovering clues and putting
them together. Your characters interact with locations, gathering
physical evidence, and supporting characters run by the GM,
gathering expert and eyewitness testimony.

The first scene presents the mystery you have to solve. You then
perform legwork, collecting information that tells you more
about the case. Each scene contains information pointing to
a new scene. Certain scenes may put a new twist on the investigation,
as the initial mystery turns out to be just one aspect of a much
bigger story. As clues accumulate, a picture of the case emerges,
until your characters arrive at a climactic scene, where all
is revealed and the bad guys confronted. A wrap-up scene accounts
for loose ends and shows the consequences of your success—or,
in rare instances, failure. (Why is failure possible at all?
Its possibility creates urgency and suspense.)

To move from scene to scene, and to solve
the overall mystery, you must gather clues. They fuel your forward
momentum.

> ### Tip For Players: Containing Speculation

> Investigative scenarios often bog down into speculative debate
between players about what could be happening. Many things can
be happening, but only one thing is. If more than one possible
explanation ties together the clues you have so far, you need
more clues.

> Whenever you get stuck, get out and gather more information.

## Gathering Clues

Gathering clues is simple. All you have to do is: 1) get yourself
into a scene where relevant information can be gathered and 2)
have the right ability to discover the clue and 3) tell the GM that
you’re using it. As long as you do these three things, you will
never fail to gain a piece of necessary information. It is never
dependent on a die roll. If you ask for it, you will get it.

You can specify exactly what you intend to achieve: “I use Cryptography to determine if the file has any hidden information.”

Or you can engage in a more general informational fishing expedition:
“I use Investigation to search the crime scene.”

If your suggested action corresponds to a clue in the scenario
notes, the GM provides you the information arising from the clue.

Some clues would be obvious to a trained investigator immediately
upon entering a scene. These passive clues are provided by the
GM without prompting. Scenarios suggest which clues are passive
and which are active, but your GM will adjust these in play depending
on how much guidance you seem to need. On a night when you’re cooking
with gas, the GM will sit back and let you prompt her for passive
clues. When you’re bogging down, she may volunteer what would
normally be active clues.

### Core Clues

For each scene, the GM designates a core clue. This is the clue
you absolutely need to move to the next scene, and thus to complete
the entire investigation. GMs will avoid making core clues available
only with the use of obscure investigative abilities. (For that
matter, the character creation system is set up so that the group
as a whole will have access to all, or nearly all, of these abilities.)
The ability the GM designates is just one possibility, not a straight
jacket – if players come up with another plausible method, the
GM should give out the information.

Some clues would be obvious to a trained investigator immediately
upon entering a scene. These passive clues are provided by the
GM without prompting. Scenarios  suggest
which clues are passive and which are active, but your GM will
adjust these in play depending on how much guidance you seem to
need. On a night when you’re cooking with gas, the GM will sit back
and let you prompt her for passive clues. When you’re bogging
down, she may volunteer what would normally be active clues.

### Special Benefits

Certain clues allow you to gain special benefits by spending
points from the relevant investigative ability pool. During
your first few scenarios, your GM will offer you the opportunity
to spend additional points as you uncover these clues. After
that it’s also up to you to ask if it there’s anything to be gained
by spending extra time or effort on a given clue. You can even propose
specific ways to improve your already good result; if your suggestion
is persuasive or entertaining, the GM may award you a special
benefit not mentioned in her scenario notes.

Each benefit costs either 1 or 2 points from the relevant pool,
depending on the difficulty of the additional action and the
scope of the reward. When asking you if you want to purchase the
benefit, the GM always tells you how much it will cost. Additional
information gained provides flavor, but is never required to
solve the case or move on to a new scene. Often it makes the character
seem clever, powerful, or heroic. It may grant you benefits useful
later in the scenario, frequently by making a favorable impression
on supporting characters. It may allow you to leap forward into
the story by gaining a clue that would otherwise only become apparent
in a later scene. On occasion, the additional information adds
an emotional dimension to the story or ties into the character’s
past history or civilian life. If you think of your GUMSHOE game
as a TV series, an extra benefit gives the actor playing your character
a juicy spotlight scene.

The act of spending points for benefits is called a spend. The
GM’s scenario notes may specify that you get Benefit X for a 1-point
spend, or Benefit Y for a 2-point spend. Sometimes minor non-core
information is available at no cost.

GMs of great mental agility who feel comfortable granting their
players influence over the details of the narrative may allow
them to specify the details of a special benefit.

If you wish to make a spend in a situation where the GM has no special
benefit to offer you, and cannot think of one that pertains at
all to the investigation, you do not lose the points you wish to
spend.

### Inconspicuous Clues

Sometimes the characters instinctively notice something without
actively looking for it. Often this situation occurs in places
they’re moving through casually and don’t regard as scenes in
need of intensive searching. The team might pass by a concealed
door, spot a droplet of blood on the marble of an immaculate hotel
lobby,  or approach a vehicle with a
bomb planted beneath it. Interpersonal abilities can also be
used to find inconspicuous clues. The classic example is of a
character whose demeanor or behavioral tics establish them
as suspicious.

It’s unreasonable to expect players to ask to use their various
abilities in what appears to be an innocuous transitional scene.
Otherwise they’d have to spend minutes of game time with every
change of scene, running down their abilities in obsessive checklist
fashion. That way madness lies.

Instead the GM asks which character has the highest current pool
in the ability in question. (When in doubt for what ability to
use for a basic search, the GM defaults to Evidence Collection.)

If two or more pools are equal, it goes to the one with the highest
rating. If ratings are also equal, their characters find the
clue at the same time.

### Simple Searches

Many clues can be found without any ability whatsoever. If an
ordinary person could credibly find a clue simply by looking
in a specified place, the clue discovery occurs automatically.
You, the reader, wouldn’t need to be a trained investigator to
find a bloody footprint on the carpet in your living room, or notice
a manila envelope taped to the underside of a table at the local
pub. By that same logic, the Investigators don’t require specific
abilities to find them, either. When players specify that they’re
searching an area for clues, they’re performing what we call
a simple search.

Vary the way you run simple searches according to pacing needs
and the preferences of your group. Some players like to feel that
their characters are interacting with the imaginary environment.
To suit them, use a call-and-response format, describing the
scene in a way that suggests places to look. The player prompts
back by zeroing in on a detail, at which point you reveal the clue:

> You: Beside the window stands a roll-top desk.

> Player: I look inside!

> You: You find an album full of old photographs.

At other times, or for players less interested in these small
moments of discovery, you might cut straight to the chase:

> You: You find an album full of old photographs in the roll-top
desk.

In the first case, the player who first voices interest in the
detail finds the clue. In the second, it goes to, at your discretion:

*  the character to whom the clue seems
most thematically suited (for example, if you’ve established
as a running motif that Agent Jenkins always stumbles on the
disgusting clues, and this clue is disgusting, tell his player
that he’s once again stepped in it)

* a player who hasn’t had a win or spotlight time for a while

* the character with the highest Perception rating

## Die Rolls

All die rolls in GUMSHOE use a single ordinary (six-sided) die.

## Tests

A test occurs when the outcome of an ability use is in doubt. Tests
apply to general skills only. Unlike information gathering
attempts, tests carry a fairly high chance of failure. They may
portend dire consequences if you lose, provide advantages if
you win, or both.

Even in the case of general skills, the GM should call for tests
only at dramatically important points in the story, and for tasks
of exceptional difficulty. Most general ability uses should
allow automatic successes, with possible bonuses on point spends,
just like investigative abilities.

There are two types of test: simple tests and contests.

### Simple Tests

A simple test occurs when the character attempts an action without
active resistance from another person or entity. Examples include
driving a treacherous road, jumping a gorge, sneaking into an
unguarded building, binding a wound, shooting a target, disconnecting
a security system, or remaining sane in the face of creeping supernatural
horror.

In the game world, expenditure of pool points in this way represents
special effort and concentration by the character, the kind
you can muster only so many times during the course of an investigation.

The GM does not reveal Difficulty Numbers beforehand. This rule
is meant to force players to decide how much they want to commit
to the situation, with the gnawing emotional dissonance that
comes from the possibility of making the wrong move.

### Boosts

Some morphs, augmentations or equipment provide boosts in one
or more Abilities. The effect of the boost depends on whether
the boost is in Investigative or General Abilities. A boost in
an Investigative Ability add 1 to the pool of the Investigative
Ability after any points have been spent from that pool. A boost
in a General Ability adds 1 to the result of any roll in that Ability.
Boosts never stack: having more than one boost for an Ability
may be useful if the boosts apply only to specific situations
(like climbing).

### Difficulty Numbers and Story Pacing

Just as the GUMSHOE system keeps the story moving by making all
crucial clues accessible to the characters, GMs must ensure
that tests and contests essential to forward narrative momentum
can be easily overcome. Assign relatively low Difficulty Numbers
of 4 or less to these crucial plot points. Reserve especially
hard Difficulty Numbers for obstacles which provide interesting
but nonessential benefits.

For example, if the characters have to sneak into the cannibal
campground in order to stage the final confrontation, assign
the relatively low Difficulty Number of 4 to the task. If it seems
to the characters that they ought to have a tougher time of it,
insert a detail justifying their ease of success. The cannibal
assigned to patrol duty might be found passed out at his post,
say.

Where it is essential to overcome a General obstacle in order
to reach a core scene, allow success whatever the result, but
give a negative consequence other than failure for the test.
For example, the PC climbs a fence, but receives an injury. This
rule never protects characters from Health or Stability loss.

The test represents the character’s best chance to succeed.
Once you fail, you’ve shot your wad and cannot retry unless you
take some other supporting action that would credibly increase
your odds of success. If allowed to do this, you must spend more
pool points than you did on the previous attempt. If you can’t
afford it, you can’t retry.

### Piggybacking

When a group of characters act in concert to perform a task together,
they designate one to take the lead. That character makes a simple
test, spending any number of his own pool points toward the task,
as usual. All other characters pay 1 point from their relevant
pools in order to gain the benefits of the leader’s action. These
points are not added to the leader’s die result. For every character
who is unable to pay this piggybacking cost, either because he
lacks pool points or does not have the ability at all, the Difficulty
Number of the attempt increases by 2.

In most instances a group cannot logically act in concert. Only
one character can drive a car at one time. Two characters with
Preparedness check their individual kits in sequence, rather
than checking a single kit at the same time.

### Cooperation

When two characters cooperate toward a single goal, they agree
which of them is undertaking the task directly, and which is assisting.
The leader may spend any number of points from her pool, adding
them to the die roll. The assistant may pay any number of points
from his pool. All but one of these is applied to the die roll.

### Continuing Challenges

For tasks where drama, verisimilitude or suspense call for a
feeling of repeated effort, assign the obstacle a pool representing
the base Difficulty of doing it all at
once unaided: this will generally be 8 or higher, often much higher.
The tests per se use the standard Difficulty of 4.

The players may take turns, cooperate on each action, or use any
other means at their disposal in a series of tests: Athletics
to batter down a door, or Digital Intrusion to penetrate a firewall,
for example. The points they roll and spend accumulate; when
they have enough points to overcome the initial Difficulty,
the task is done. No points or rolls spent on a failed test add to
the total.

Characters can’t render an impossible task possible just by
applying the continuing challenge rules.

### Zero Sum Contests

A zero sum contest occurs when something bad or good is definitely
going to happen to one of the PCs, and you need to find out which
one takes the hit. Each player makes a test of a general ability.
A zero sum contest can be positive or negative. In a positive contest,
the character with the highest result gets a benefit. In a negative
contest, the one with the lowest result suffers an ill consequence.
When embarking on a contest with an open Difficulty, inform the
players that this is an open Difficulty, and whether this is a
positive or negative test. They then decide in advance how many
points to spend to modify their rolls, keeping this number secret
from other players by writing it down on a piece of paper. They
then roll the dice, reveal their expenditures, and announce
their final results. You can cap the maximum spend.

Be cautious when treating events with negative outcomes as zero
sum contests. Because they guarantee that something bad will
definitely happen to one of the PCs, make sure that the negative
consequence is distressing but does no permanent harm to the
character.

Worse results of zero sum contests are acceptable if the characters
have had some other fair chance to avoid exposure to the bad situation.

If players are tied for best result (in the case of a positive test)
or worst (in a negative test), the tied players may subsequently
spend any number of additional points from the pool in question,
in hopes of breaking the tie in their favor. Should results remain
tied after additional expenditures, the GM chooses the winner
based on story considerations.

### General Spends

Occasionally you’ll want to create a task at which there is no
reasonable chance of failure, but which should cost the characters
a degree of effort. To do this, simply charge the character(s)
a number of points from relevant general ability pools. Where
tasks can be performed by cooperative effort, multiple characters
may contribute points to them. 1 or 2 points per character is a
reasonable general spend.

### Making General Tests Without Abilities

You can always make a test of any general ability if your rating
is 1 or more, whether or not you currently have points in its pool.
You can never test a general ability when your rating is 0.

### Toll Tests

In a toll test, your success is assured, if you want it enough,
but the cost of your effort is not. The GM informs you of the Difficulty;
you roll the die without announcing an expenditure. Once you
see the die result, you then decide whether to spend the points
needed to bridge the gap between die roll and Difficulty, or to
allow yourself to fail. The base Difficulty of a toll test is 6,
which may be modified upwards as circumstances warrant.

### Contests

Contests occur when two characters, often a player character
and a supporting character controlled by the GM, actively attempt
to thwart one another. Although contests can resolve various
physical match-ups, in a horror game the most common contest
is the chase, in which the investigators run away from slavering
entities intent on ripping them limb from limb.

In a contest, each character acts in turn. The first to fail a roll
of the contested ability loses. The GM decides who acts first.
In a chase, the character who bolts from the scene acts first.
Where the characters seem to be acting at the same time, the one
with the lowest rating in the relevant ability acts first. In
the event of a tie, supporting characters act before player characters.
In the event of a tie between player characters, the player who
arrived last for the current session goes first in the contest.

The first character to act makes a test of the ability in question.
If he fails, he loses the contest. If he succeeds, the second character
then makes a test. This continues until one character loses,
at which point the other one wins.

Typically each character attempts to beat a Difficulty Number
of 4.

Where the odds of success are skewed in favor of one contestant,
the GM may assign different Difficulties to each. A character
with a significant advantage gets a lower Difficulty Number.
A character facing a major handicap faces a higher Difficulty
Number. When in doubt, the GM assigns the lower number to the advantaged
participant.

Throughout the contest, GM and players should collaborate to
add flavor to each result, explaining what the characters did
to remain in the contest. That way, instead of dropping out of
the narration to engage in an arithmetical recitation, you keep
the fictional world verbally alive .

## Fighting

Fights are slightly more complicated contests involving any
of the following abilities:

* Melee Combat vs. Melee Combat: the characters are fighting
in close quarters.

* Shooting vs. Shooting: the characters are apart from one another
and trying to hit each other with guns or other missile weapons

Initiative: Determine whether the character who attempts to
strike the first blow seizes the initiative and therefore gets
the first opportunity to strike his opponent, or if his intended
target anticipates his attack and beats him to the punch—or shot,
as the case may be.

As GUMSHOE is player-facing, how this works depends on whether
the PC in the situation is the aggressor or the defender.

In a Melee Combat contest, the PC gets to go first if his Melee Combat
rating equals or exceeds that of his target.

In a Shooting contest, he gets to go first if his Shooting rating
exceeds that of his target.

Otherwise, the opponent goes first.

In the rare instance where two PCs fight one another (when one
of them is possessed, say), the PC with the higher applicable
rating (Melee Combat or Shooting) goes first. If their ratings
tie but their pools do not, the one with the higher pool goes first.
If both are tied, roll a die, with one player going first on an odd
result and the other on even.

A contest proceeds between the two abilities. When combatants
using the Melee Combat or Shooting abilities roll well, they
get the opportunity to deal damage to their opponents.

**Hit Thresholds:** Each character has a Hit Threshold of either
3 (the standard value) or 4 (if the character’s Athletics rating
is 8 or more.) The Hit Threshold is the Difficulty Number the character’s
opponent must match or beat in order to harm him. Less competent
supporting characters may have lower Hit Thresholds. Creatures
may have Hit Thresholds of 4 or higher, regardless of their Athletics
ratings.

**Dealing Damage:** When you roll on or over your opponent’s Hit Threshold,
you may deal damage to him. To do so, you make a damage roll, rolling
a die which is then modified according to the relative lethality
of your weapon, as per the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------
Weapon                                          Damage
Type                                            Modifier
----------------------------------------------- ------------
Fist, kick                                        –2

Small improvised weapon, police baton, knife      –1

Machete, heavy club, light firearm                +0

Sword, heavy firearm                              +1

Very heavy firearm, all guns used with Gunnery    +2
----------------------------------------------------------

For firearms, add an additional +2 when fired at point blank range.

Characters may never spend points from their combat pools to
increase their damage rolls.

The final damage result is then subtracted from your opponent’s
Health pool. When a combatant’s Health pool drops to 0 or less,
that combatant begins to suffer ill effects, ranging from slight
impairment to helplessness to death; see sidebar.

Unlike other contests, participants do not lose when they fail
their test rolls. Instead, they’re forced out of the fight when
they lose consciousness or become seriously wounded.

## Exhaustion, Injury and Death

Unlike most abilities, your Health pool can drop below 0.

**When it does this, you must make a Consciousness Roll**. Roll a die
with the absolute value of your current Health pool as your Difficulty.
You may deliberately strain yourself to remain conscious, voluntarily
reducing your Health pool by an amount of your choice. For each
point you reduce it, add 1 to your die result. The Difficulty of
the Consciousness roll is based on your Health pool before you
make this reduction.

**If your pool is anywhere from 0 to –5**, you are hurt, but have suffered
no permanent injury, beyond a few superficial cuts and bruises.
However the pain of your injuries makes it impossible to spend
points on Investigative abilities, and increases the Difficulty
Numbers of all tests and contests, including opponents’ Hit
Thresholds, by 1.

A character with the Medic ability can improve your condition
by spending Medic points. For every Medic point spent, you regain
2 Health points—unless you are the Medic, in which case you gain
only 1 Health point for every Medic point spent. The Medic can
only refill your pool to where you were before the incident in
which you received this latest injury. He must be in a position
to devote all of his attention to directly tending to your wounds.

**If your pool is between –6 and –11**, you have been seriously wounded.
You must make a Consciousness roll.

Whether or not you maintain consciousness, you are no longer
able to fight. Until you receive first aid, you will lose an additional
Health point every half hour. A  character
with the Medic ability can stabilize your condition by spending
2 Medic points. However, he can’t restore your Health points.

Even after you receive first aid, you must convalesce in a hospital
or similar setting for a period of days. Your period of forced
inactivity is a number of days equal to the positive value of your
lowest Health pool score. (So if you were reduced to –8 Health,
you are hospitalized for 8 days.) On the day of your discharge,
your Health pool increases to half its maximum value. On the next
day, it refreshes fully.

**When your pool dips to –12 or below, your morph is dead or destroyed.** Time to figure out when your last backup was taken.

### Bigger Fights

Combat becomes more chaotic when two groups of combatants fight,
or a group gangs up against a single opponent.

If one group of combatants is surprised by the other, the surprising
side goes before the surprised side.

Otherwise, determine initiative as follows.

**Close-up fight:** if any PC has a Melee Combat rating equal to or
greater than than any combatant on the other side, the PCs act
first.

**Shoot-out:** if any PC has a Shooting rating equal to or greater
than than any combatant on the other side, the PCs act first.

Shoot-outs may devolve into scuffles; this does not alter the
already-established initiative order.

The time it takes to go through the ranking order once, with each
character taking an action, is called a round. When one round
ends, another begins.

In the course of each round, either the PCs or their enemies go
first, as already established by the initiative order. Then
the other side responds. The order in which the two sides act remains
unchanged from round to round.

During the portion of the round devoted to the PCs, each participating
PC makes an attack in sequence, according to the players’ seating
order, from left to right. Sequence becomes irrelevant, obviously,
when only one PC is participating (or still standing) in the fight.

In their portion of the round, opponent(s) respond with their
own wave of attack attempts, ordered by the characters they’re
targeting, again using a left to right player seating order.
Where multiple opponents attack a single PC, the GM determines
their order of action in whatever manner she finds convenient—usually
the order in which she’s tracking them in her rough notes.

The order of action can therefore change
slightly from round to round for the PCs’ opponents, but not for
the PCs.

Some beings may strike more than once per round. They make each
attack in succession, and may divide them up between opponents
within range, or concentrate all of them on a single enemy. GMs
order these attacks in whatever order they find convenient,
so long as they fall within portion of the round devoted to enemy
attacks. Usually it’s easiest to have them act against multiple
PCs at once, starting when they reach the first target in the seating
order

When called upon to act, each character may strike at any opponent
within range of his weapons.

Creatures may choose to use their actions to deal additional
damage to downed or helpless opponents rather than engage active
opponents. They automatically deal once instance of damage
per action. Only the most crazed and bestial human enemies engage
in this behavior.

Characters who join a combat in progress come last in order of
precedence. If more than two characters join during the same
round, the GM determines their relative precedence using the
rules above.

The fight continues until one side capitulates or flees, or all
of its members are unconscious or otherwise unable to continue.

### Surprise

Player characters are surprised when they find themselves suddenly
in a dangerous situation. Avoid being surprised with a successful
Sense Trouble test. The basic Difficulty is 4, adjusted by the
opponent’s Stealth Modifier.

Player characters surprise supporting characters by sneaking
up on them with a successful Infiltration test. The basic Difficulty
is 4, adjusted by the opponent’s Alertness modifier.

Surprised characters suffer a +2 increase to all general ability
Difficulties for any immediately subsequent action. In a fight,
the penalty pertains to the first round of combat.

### Armor

Armor may reduce the damage from certain weapon types. If you’re
wearing a form of armor effective against the weapon being used
against you, you subtract a number of points from each instance
of damage dealt to you before applying it to your Health pool.

Body armor marks you out as someone looking for trouble. 
This applies doubly to military-grade body armor. Investigators can’t
expect to walk around openly wearing armor without attracting
the attention of the law-enforcement team. Armor and heavy weapons
may prove useful in discrete missions conducted away from prying
eyes.

See [Gear: Armor](#gear-armor) for more details on armor.

### Cover

In a typical gunfight, combatants seek cover, hiding behind
walls, furniture or other barriers, exposing themselves only
for the few seconds it takes them to pop up and fire a round at their
targets. The GUMSHOE rules recognize three cover conditions:

**Exposed:** No barrier stands between you and the combatant firing
at you. Your Hit Threshold decreases by 1.

**Partial Cover:** About half of your body is exposed to fire. Your
Hit Threshold remains unchanged.

**Full Cover:** Except when you pop up to fire a round, the barrier
completely protects you from incoming fire. Your Hit Threshold
increases by 1.

### One Gun, Two Combatants

If your opponent has a gun well in hand and ready to fire, and you
charge him from more than five feet away, he can empty his entire
clip or chamber at you before you get to him, badly injuring you.
You are automatically hit. He rolls one instance of damage, which
is then tripled. Yes, we said tripled. And, yes, the tripling
occurs after weapon modifiers are taken into account. This is
why few people charge when their opponents have the drop on them.

If your opponent has a pistol but it is not well in hand and ready
to fire, you may attempt to jump him and wrestle it from his grip.
If he has a pistol well in hand but is unaware of your presence,
you may also be able to jump him, at the GM’s discretion. The characters
engage in a Melee Combat contest to see which of them gets control
of the gun and fires it. The winner makes a damage roll against
the loser, using the pistol’s Damage Modifier, including the
+2 for point blank range.

If you jump an opponent with an unready rifle, a Melee Combat combat
breaks out, with the opponent using the rifle as a heavy club.

### Ammo Capacity

GUMSHOE sets aside the loving attention to firearm intricacies
characteristic of most RPG systems. For example,
characters need reload only  when dramatically
appropriate. Otherwise, they’re assumed to be able to refill
the cylinders of their revolvers or jam clips into their automatic
weapons between shots.

When reloading is an issue, GMs may request a Shooting test (Difficulty
3) to quickly reload. Characters who fail may not use their Shooting
ability to attack during the current round.

### Range

The effect of range on firearms combat is likewise simplified
nearly out of existence. Handguns and shotguns can only be accurately
fired at targets within fifty meters. The range limit for rifles
is one hundred meters.

### Non-Lethal Weapons

In GUMSHOE, non-lethal attacks never take an opponent out faster
than standard combat. Otherwise players will have their characters
simply knock their enemies out and kill them in cold blood, which
is unsympathetic and out of genre. Thus tasers and stun guns work
less effectively in the game than in real life.

### Fighting Without Abilities

A character with a Shooting rating of 0 is not allergic to guns.
Anyone can pick up a revolver and empty it in the general direction
of the foe. Likewise, a character with no Melee Combat ability
is not going to just ignore the fire axe sitting on the wall when
a blood bursts through a partition wall.

However, such characters will use their weapons ineffectively
and hesitantly. Using a weapon (including fists or feet) without
ability has the following drawbacks:

* You automatically do an additional -2 damage

* You must declare your action at the beginning of each round
and cannot change it if the tactical situation alters.

* You automatically go last in each round.

* If you are using a firearm, a roll of 1 means you have accidentally
shot yourself or one of your allies, as selected (or rolled
randomly) by the GM. Do damage as normal (including your automatic
-2 penalty).

### Called Shots

In certain situations simply hitting an enemy isn’t enough:
you need to get him in a particular spot. When taking a called shot,
specify the desired location of the strike and any additional
intended effect other than injury to the opponent. The GM decides
whether this is a likely outcome of such a hit. If it is clearly
not a likely outcome, and your character would logically know
this, she warns you in advance, so you can do something else instead.

The GM then adds 1 to 4 points to the target’s Hit Threshold, depending
on the additional difficulty entailed. Use the following table
as a guideline. Body locations assume a human of ordinary size.
Hit Threshold modifiers for ordinary body parts of
extraordinary creatures are left as an exercise for the GM. Vehicle
locations are in italics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Desired                                                                  Modifier
Location                                                                   to Hit 
                                                                        Threshold
---------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------
Large carried object (rocket launcher, laptop computer, backpack)            +1

Torso, *windshield*                                                          +1

Chest (if attacker is facing target)                                         +2

Gut, *specific window, tail rotor*                                           +2

Head or limb                                                                 +2

Hand or foot, joint, *tire*                                                  +3

Heart, throat, mouth, or face                                                +3

Weapon or other hand-held object                                             +3

Eye, *headlight*                                                             +4

Chest (if target faces away from attacker)                                   +4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the new Hit Threshold determined, you then make a combat
ability test, as per the standard rules. If you succeed, your
specified effect occurs as desired.

If you struck an ordinary person in the head, throat, or chest
with a weapon, add +2 to the damage; hitting the heart adds +3 to
the damage. Neither can be combined with a point-blank gunshot,
which is already assumed to hit a vital location.

If you struck an ordinary person in a joint (wrist, knee, etc.)
or throat with an aimed hand-to-hand blow, lock, or kick, add
+2 to the damage; hitting an eye adds +3 to the damage.

This assumes a trained, targeted strike intended to disable
or cripple. You may narrate some other crippling strike to suit
your own specific martial arts idiom, but the modifiers remain
the same if you want to do the extra damage.

If, after this damage is dealt, the victim is already Hurt but
not Seriously Wounded, you may then pay an additional 6 points
from the fighting ability you are using to reduce the target to
-6 Health. If the target is already Seriously Wounded you may
then pay an additional 6 Shooting, Weapons, or Hand-to-Hand
points (whichever applies) to kill the target outright.

### Running Away

Fleeing from an ongoing fight requires an Athletics test. The
Difficulty is 3 plus the number of foes you're fleeing from: to
flee one enemy is Difficulty 4, fleeing two
enemies is Difficulty 5, fleeing four enemies is Difficulty
7. On a success, melee ends and you flee; if they intend to chase
you, your foes must roll first in the ensuing full contest of Athletics.
If you fail, the opponent with the highest damage value automatically
deals one instance of damage to you. Melee still ends, but you
must roll first in the ensuing chase.

In situations where it seems appropriate to make flight more
difficult, on a failure, any directly engaged opponent might
spend 3 Athletics to block you from fleeing—interposing himself
between you and the exit, tackling you, slamming the garage doors,
or whatever the narrative description warrants. In this case,
your enemies forgo the damage they would otherwise deal.

### Explosions

Explosions are simplified with the use of three ranges. A character
may be so close to an explosion that it is instantly fatal. This
range depends on the explosive device, and small explosions
may not have this range.

The second range is for characters that are not close enough to
die immediately, but are in the open when the explosion happens.
They take full damage from the blast. The damage is one die plus
a number ranging from +1 to +12.

The third range is for characters that are in cover or outside
the direct blast radius, but still close enough to be harmed by
the explosion. If they succeed in an Athletics test, they don't
take damage. Otherwise, they take damage of one die + half of what
the modifier was for the previous category.

It is often up to the person installing the explosive what the
danger zones are, with targeted or guided explosions. A failure
to install an explosive successfully results in a larger or smaller
are of explosion, or lesser or greater damage.

The exact amount of damage depends on the explosive used, the
amount used and the skill of the person targeting the explosion.
It is also a question of narrative convenience: explosives set
by enemies usually have a narrative goal.

You should be given a Sense Trouble roll when you are entering
the close range of an explosive device, unless it is already clear
that there is an explosive device present. You should not die
from a blast that you did not see coming – it is the GM's job to tell
you about it. If you choose to stay within the blast radius – to
save civilians, to defuse the bomb etc. – you have made the choice
to stay behind and your fate may be up to the dice.

## Hazards

In or out of combat, the characters’ survival may be threatened
by assorted hazards, from electrical shock to poisoning.

### Electricity and Other Shocks

Damage from exposure to electricity varies according to voltage.
You can suffer:

**Mild shock**, equivalent to briefly touching an ungrounded
wire or damaged electrical appliance. You lose 1 Health and are
blown backwards for a couple of meters.

**Moderate shock**, equivalent to a jolt from a cattle prod.
You lose 2 Health and (if in combat time) your next four actions.
You always lose at least one action, but may buy off the loss of
other actions by paying 3 Athletics points per action.

**Extreme shock**, equivalent to a lightning strike. You suffer
one die of damage, with a +4 modifier.

The GM should always give you some opportunity to avoid being
shocked, whether it be an Athletics test to avoid unexpected
contact, or a Sense Trouble test to spot the danger.

If you are reduced to –6 or fewer Health, the current is assumed
to have traveled through your heart or brain, causing cardiac
arrest or brain damage, respectively. The GM describes appropriate
symptoms and futuristic treatments during your sick bay convalescence.

### Other Hazards

Many other hazards can be emulated using the mild/moderate/extreme
breakdown above. Simply change the narrative description and
side effects, keeping the Health pool losses.

#### Example Hazard Description: Alien Fungal Infection

##### Mild:
For the next two intervals, you lose 2 Health every
time you make an Athletics test.

##### Moderate:
Make a Health test against a Difficulty of 4. If
you fail, you suffer an extreme shock at the beginning of the next
interval.

### Fire

Damage from exposure to fire varies according to the surface
area of your body exposed to the flame, and repeats for each round
(or, outside of combat, every few seconds) you remain exposed
to it.

**Minor exposure**, most often to an extremity like a hand or foot,
carries a damage modifier of –2.

**Partial exposure**, to up to half of your surface area, carries
a damage modifier of +0.

**Extensive exposure**, to half or more of your surface area, imposes
a damage modifier of +2.

The GM should always give you a chance
to avoid being set on fire. The difficulty of extinguishing a
flame is usually 4, but might be higher for anomalous flame-like
manifestations, or when you are coated with a futuristic accelerant.

### Suffocation

When deprived of air, you get two minutes before the nastiness
kicks in. After that point, you lose 1 Athletics every ten seconds,
as you struggle to hold your breath. Once that pool depletes,
you start losing Health, at a rate of 1 point every five seconds.

### Toxins

Toxins are either inhaled, ingested or injected directly into
the bloodstream. They vary widely in lethality. A dose of a low-tech
cleaning substance may impose a damage modifier of –2, where
a viro-active nerve gas might range from +6 to +16. Inhaled toxins
tend to take effect right away. Injected and ingested toxins
take delayed effect, anywhere from minutes to hours after exposure.
Their damage might be parceled out in increments, and may prevent
you from refreshing Health points until somehow neutralized.
As with any hazard, the GM should always give you a chance to avoid
exposure to them.

## Digital Minds

Bodies can be exchanged, minds can’t. Encountering horrors
in space makes characters lose Stability, but fortunately digital
minds can be repaired with psychosurgery.

### Stability Tests

Mental stresses can take you out of commission, temporarily
or permanently, as easily as physical injury.

When an incident challenges your fragile sanity, make a Stability
test against a Difficulty Number of 4.

If you fail, you lose a number of Stability points. The severity
of the loss depends on the situation. As with any other test of
a general ability, you are always permitted to spend Stability
points to provide a bonus to your roll. However, it’s never a good
bet to spend more points than you stand to lose if you fail.

Your Stability loss from failed tests is capped at the worst incident
in that scene. Points spent on providing bonuses are still lost.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Incident                                                         Stability Loss
---------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
Encountering non-sentient aliens                                       2

A human opponent attacks you with 
evident intent to do serious harm                                      2

Encountering highly advanced or exsurgent-modifed technology           2

You are in a accident serious enough to pose a risk of injury          2

A human opponent attacks you with evident intent to kill               3

You are brought back from a backup after dying                         3

Experiencing someone’s death via XP                                    3

Encountering sentient aliens                                           4

You see an particularly grisly murder or accident scene                4

You learn that a friend or loved one has been violently killed         4

Encountering an exsurgent-infected transhuman                          4

You discover the corpse of a friend or loved one                       6

Encountering hostile aliens or exsurgent life forms                    7

You see a friend or loved one killed                                   7

You see a friend or loved one killed 
in a particularly gruesome manner                                      8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

GMs should feel free to assess Stability Losses for other incidents,
using the examples provided as a benchmark.

Characters make a single roll per incident, based on its highest
potential Stability loss.

Groups craving an additional point of complexity can occasionally
alter Difficulty Numbers for Stability tests depending on the
character’s attitude toward the destabilizing event. Characters
who would logically be inured to a given event face a Difficulty
of 3, while those especially susceptible face a 5. A character
whose daytime identity is that of a surgeon or coroner might,
for example, face a lowered Difficulty when encountering gruesomely
mutilated bodies. No character type gets a break when encountering
exsurgent creatures or other existential threats.

### Losing It

Like Health, your Stability pool can drop below 0.

**If your Stability ranges from 0 to –5**, you are shaken.

Difficulty Numbers for all general abilities increase by 1,
and it becomes more difficult to use investigative abilities.

If you want to make an Investigative spend, make a test with the
absolute value of your current Stability pool as your Difficulty.
You may deliberately strain yourself, voluntarily reducing
your Stability pool by an amount of your choice. For each point
you reduce it, add 1 to your die result. The Difficulty of the Stability
test is based on your Stability pool before you make this reduction.
If you fail, you still make the spend, but you should roleplay
this failure.

**If your Stability ranges from –6 to –11**, you acquire a mental illness.

This stays with you even after your Stability pool is restored
to normal. See below for more. You also continue to suffer the
ill effects of being shaken. Furthermore,
you permanently lose 1 point from your Stability rating. The
only way to get it back it to purchase it again with build points.

**When your Stability reaches –12 or less**, you are incurably insane.
You may commit one last crazy act, which must either be self-destructively
heroic or self-destructively destructive. Or you may choose
merely to gibber and drool. Assuming you survive your permanent
journey to the shores of madness, your character is quietly shipped
off to cold storage, never to be seen again. Time to create a new
character.

### Mental Illness

If driven to mental illness you face a range of possible mental
disorders. The GM rolls on the following chart or chooses a disorder
based on the triggering circumstance. The player is then sent
out of the room, while the GM and other players collaborate on
a way to heighten his sense of dislocation and disorientation.

1. Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD.) You are haunted
by dreams of the incident, and spend your days in a constant
state of anxiety and alert, as if prepared for it to repeat
itself at any moment. Whenever your senses register any input
reminding you of the incident, you must make a Stability test
(Difficulty 4) or freeze up. If you freeze up, you are unable
to take any action for fifteen minutes and remain shaken (see
above) for twenty-four hours after that. Tests to see if you
show symptoms of PTSD do not in and of themselves lower your
Stability pool.

2. Delusion. The other players and GM decide on a mundane detail
of the world which is no longer true and has never been true.
For example, there might be no such thing as a squirrel, a Volkswagen,
or orange juice. Maybe John Lennon was never assassinated,
or never existed in the first place. PCs and supporting characters
deny knowledge of the chosen item, person, or event.

3. Homicidal Mania. The GM takes the player aside, tells him
that he knows one of the other players is a supernatural creature,
and tells him just how to kill the monster.

4. Megalomania. When the character fails at a dramatic moment,
the GM describes the outcome of his ability attempt as successful,
then asks the player to leave the room. Then the GM describes
the real results to the other players, and invites the megalomaniac
player back into the room.

5. Multiple Personality Disorder. At moments of stress, another
player is assigned control of the character, speaking and
acting as if he’s an entirely different person.

6. Paranoia. The other players are instructed to act as if they’re
trying to keep straight faces when the affected player returns.
Occasionally they exchange notes, make hand signals to the
GM, or use meaningless code words, as if communicating something
important the player is unaware of.

7. Selective Amnesia. The group decides on an event that did
happen in the world that the player has now forgotten all about.
He’s married, or killed  someone,
or pseudonymously written a best-selling book. Everyone
he meets refers to this new, verifiable fact that he has no
knowledge of.

### Psychological Triage

If a character is acting in an erratic manner due to mental illness,
a another character can spend 1 point of Reassurance to snap him
into a state of temporary lucidity. He will then act rationally
for the remainder of the current scene.

#### Psychosurgery

Using Psychosurgery requires specialized equipment that is
not easily portable. This equipment should usually be available
to characters with Psychosurgery, but reaching it may take time
and effort.

##### Psychotherapy

A character with the Psychosurgery ability can spend points
from that pool to help another character regain spent Stability
points. For every Psychosurgery point spent, the recipient
gains 2 Stability points.

Mental illness can be cured through prolonged treatment using
the Psychosurgery ability. At the beginning of each scenario,
in a prologue scene preceding the main action, the character
administering the treatment makes a Psychosurgery test (Difficulty
4.) After three consecutive successful tests, and three consecutive
scenarios in which the patient remains above 0 Stability at all
times, the mental illness goes away.

However, if the character ever again acquires a mental illness,
he regains the condition he was previously cured of. Permanent
cure then becomes impossible.

A successful Psychosurgery test undertaken during the course
of a scenario suppresses its symptoms until the patient next
suffers a Stability loss.

## Using Networking Abilities and Resources {#networking-and-resources}

Networking abilities and Resources are General Abilities,
but also work as Investigative Abilities.

Whether it is appropriate to use Networking Abilities or Resources
depends on the surrounding economy. If it is an old economy, only
Resources can be used to acquire goods and services, but both
Networking Abilities and Resources work for getting information.
If it is a transitional economy, both can be used for all purposes.
In the new economy, only Networking Abilities are effective.

In some cases only Resources or a specific Networking Ability
can be used. Paying a ransom can’t be accomplished without Resources,
although Networking may help in acquiring those Resources.
Convincing the local crime syndicate that you’re trustworthy
can’t be accomplished with Resources and only the Networking:
Criminals Ability is appropriate.

### Burning Points from Rating

If you don’t have enough points in your pool to pay for the cost
of using Networking Abilities or Resources, you can burn points
from your rating. These count as points spent from the pool, but
are lost permanently. You still count as having a rating in that
Ability for the purposes of finding core clues until the end of
the current scenario and should work with the other players and
the gamemaster to ensure that that Ability is also covered in
future scenarios.

### Burning I-Rep

Firewall operatives may burn 1 point of i-rep to send a priority
request that guarantees any and all resources that they request
and Firewall can supply. This doesn’t mean that the character
gets exactly what they request, as Firewall may simply not have
the resources requested in the time frame they are needed in.

Burning i-rep for a priority request marks the request as being
necessary to combat an impending and immediate existential
risk. Misusing i-rep by sending an unnecessary priority request
leads to the character losing all their remaining i-rep rating.

### Networking and Resources Tests

Trivial favors don’t require tests, only a rating of 1 or more
in the relevant Ability. Other favors are treated as Toll Tests,
with the player first rolling the die and then deciding whether
the favor requested is worth the spend.

Asking for information that is necessary to complete the story
is always free. **Core clues are always free to acquire, and don’t
require tests, only the use of an appropriate ability.**

Other requests have the following difficulties:

### Acquire Gear

------------------------------------------------------

----------- ------------------------------------------
0           Acquire gear with an expense of Trivial.

4           Acquire gear with an expense of Low.

## Gear {#gear}

Any gear with a cost can be bought with Resources or acquired through
Network, according to the rules in the previous section.

Gear may also be had with a Preparedness test. These items need
not be bought with Resources or acquired through Network. Well
prepared characters may simply have them handy. You make a simple
test; if you succeed, you have the item you want. The difficulty
for the Preparedness test is the difficulty given in the gear
table +2.

You needn’t do this in advance of the adventure, but can dig into
your kit bag (provided you’re able to get to it) as the need arises.
Once it is established that you have a piece of gear, you always
have it with you, at least until you change morphs or get separated
from your gear. You can’t use Preparedness to suddenly have augmentations
that weren’t in your morph to begin with.

Gear comes in two different types: **augmentations** and **equipment**.
The only difference between these two is whether the gear is internal
or external to your current morph. Augmentations are internal
to the morph and can’t be easily removed and adding them requires
surgery. Equipment is external and can be easily added or removed,
usually by simply picking items up or dropping them down.

**Gear are divided into five cost categories: Trivial, Low, Moderate, High, and Expensive.** Their effectiveness is dependent on the cost: more costly equipment is more effective.

**Gear with a cost of Trivial is commonplace**,
easy to manufacture and acquire. These items don't usually give
mechanical benefits, but may be necessary to acquire for other
reasons. Examples: 

* food and drink 
* opera tickets or a taxi fare
* melee weapons of -1 damage

**Gear with a cost of Low enable the use of an Ability.** Characters are usually assumed to have the tools to use their abilities, but this might not always
be the case. Characters with Art don't usually carry around oil
colors in case they need to paint a painting in the style of the
Renaissance masters. Examples:

* first-aid kit for Medicine
* a make-up kit for Impersonate
* a rental car for Ground Craft
* basic firearms, with pistols starting at +0 damage
* light body armor

**Gear with a cost of Moderate enable the use of an Ability in an enhanced way or enable new kinds of actions.** This is usually a specific
benefit to a way of using an Ability. Moderate cost equipment may also enable
way ways of acting, like breathing under water, surviving in
vacuum or staying awake (or sleeping) for long periods of time.
Gear with Moderate cost may also make you gain 2 points in a General
Ability pool in some specific circumstance. Note: no gear makes you automatically gain Health or Stability. Examples:

* a boost to all uses of Athletics for climbing or swimming or a boost to all uses of a type of advanced mathematics.
* a berserker-augmentation or drug that makes you regain 2 points of Melee Combat after being wounded for the first time, 
* a tactical AI that makes you gain 2 points of Sense Trouble after engaging in shooting combat.
* Heavy body armor
* heavy weapons (+1 damage)

**Gear with a cost of High give a boost in any one Ability.** Gear with
High cost may also make you gain 4 points in a General Ability pool
in some specific circumstance. Note: no gear makes you automatically
gain Health or Stability. Very heavy weapons (+2 damage) are
High cost. Examples:

* a fighting exoskeleton for Melee Combat
* muscle augmentation for Athletics
* advanced cracking tools for Infosec
* a smart stealth suit that helps you regain 4 points of Infiltration once by staying still in darkness

**Gear with a cost of Expensive are either items usually rarely owned by private persons**, like farcasters, vehicles like cars
or shuttles, or specialized equipment. Using Expensive gear may refresh
up to 3 pools in General Abilities in some circumstances or return
Health over a period of time. Examples:

* specialized equipment, like quantum computers and desktop cornucopia machines
* exotic weapons, with +1 or +2 damage and other features, like sniper
rifles with a long range
* combat AI that refreshes Athletics, Melee Combat and Shooting when fighting against the same or similar foes

The following chapters list example equipment, but you are free to come up with new equipment following these guidelines.

### Personal Augmentation

Equipment cost is listed after its name.

Some equipment is only applicable to biological morphs. For example, synthmorphs don't need sleep, so Circadian Regulation is unnecessary for them.

#### Adrenal Boost, High

You gain 4 points in Melee Combat when you are first damaged in combat. If you also have endocrine control, you can activate adrenal boost at will.

#### Bioweave Armor, Low (light)/Moderate (heavy)

Your skin is armored. With light bioweave armor you get 1 armor against shooting. With heavy bioweave armor you get 1 armor against shooting and melee combat. +1 Cost to use Perception for touch-related information. Cumulative with worn armor.

#### Carapace Armor, Moderate

2 armor against shooting and 2 against melee combat. Not cumulative with worn armor.

#### Circadian Regulation, Moderate

You need only 2 hours of sleep.

#### Claws, Low

Cybernetic claws. Unarmed damage is -1.

#### Cosmetic Mods
Assume any cosmetic modification for the cost of Trivial, Low if the modification is exotic (fins, feathers etc.)

#### Eelware, Low

Implanted shock weapon with +0 Damage.

#### Endocrine Control, High

Boost to Flirting, Impersonate or Flattery. Player chooses which one when acquiring. +2 to rolls against suffering from hunger, fear, or emotional manipulation. Can stay awake for 48 hours.

#### Hyperlinguist, High

Boost to Languages.

#### Math Boost, Moderate

Boost to any Test requiring math calculations. (Note however that this is not a free boost to all Infosec Tests or similar. Using specific skill requires more than simply calculations.)

#### Muscle Augmentation, High

Boost to Athletics.

#### Prehensile Feet, Moderate

Boost to Athletics in zero-g environments. Compensates for any additional difficulty added to Hardware or Melee Combat by being in zero-g environment by 1 point.

#### Prehensile Tail, Moderate

Boost to Athletics in tests of balance. Can be used for grasping objects.

#### Sex Switch, Moderate

Can change sex to male, female, hermaphrodite or neuter in a week.

#### Temperature Tolerance, Moderate

#### Smart Skin, Low

1 armor against shooting and melee combat, may be worn with other armor, takes 1 round to activate

#### Spray Armor, Low

1 armor against shooting, works only when worn by biomorphs, degrades in 24 h

### Communications

The oldest and most widespread communications
technology still in regular use is radio. Every habitat
and world inhabited by transhumanity is awash in
radio traffic, with humans, machines, and uplifts all
constantly communicating with one another. The
smallest radios are no larger than a speck of dust
and have a range of no more than 20 meters, while
the largest are the size of a truck and have a range
of many thousands of miles. Radios large and small
are ubiquitous and almost all devices contain at least
short-range radios so they may interact with the
mesh. Most morphs are equipped with basic mesh
inserts that include an implanted radio.

#### Quantum Farcasters, Low to Expensive

Quantum farcasters need to be entangled with each
other by being present in the same location, but
the quantum encryption between them cannot be
broken.

Quantum farcasters range from small and local to
large and capable of instant long range communications
over any distance.

### Covert and Espionage Tech

#### Chameleon Cloak, Low

A loose, poncho-like cloak that perceives the surroundings
and replicates it on its surface. The user can take choose
to take a roll of 4 instead of rolling a die when stationary
and gives a boost to all Infiltration rolls.

#### Cover Operations Tool (COT), High

A handheld device which contains sensors and smart tools
for infiltration. Gives a boost to all tests to bypass a lock.

#### Disabler, High

A device that can be attached to a (helpless) synthetic
morph's or pod's head. Emits an overloading signal that
effectively shuts down the person's cyberbrain until the
disabler is shut down.

#### Psi Jammer, Moderate

A small device that stops the use of ranged psi sleights.

#### Quantum Computer, Expensive

Advanced device capable of quantum computer. Gives a boost
to all Infosec rolls.

#### Smart Dust, Moderate

A small nanobot generator that creates a cloud of tiny
nanobots. When released, the nanobots cover all surfaces
in a room over a period of 20 minutes. The nanobots
analyze all substances on the surfaces, allowing the
use of Biology, Chemistry and Investigation on the 
samples collected.

#### Traction Pads, Low

Gloves, shoes and kneepads designed for climbing. Boost 
to Athletics when climbing. Maximum difficulty for
climbing tests is 4.

#### White Noise Machine, Trivial

Generates masking sounds that protect from eavesdropping.

### Everyday Technology

#### Portable Sensor, Moderate

Small portable sensor system. Can be of several types, for example infrared, lidar, radar, x-ray. Can give a boost to Abilities in some circumstances. For example, using a x-ray sensor to scan through a room may help in Investigation.

#### Smart Clothing, Low

May change its color, texture and even its cut in just couple of minutes. Can give a boost to Infiltration if the wearer doesn't move faster than a slow walk. Will also keep the wearer comfortable in temperatures ranging from -40 to 70 C.

#### Smart Vac Clothing, Moderate

Like smart clothing, but can also transform into a light vacsuit.

#### Specs, Low

Vision-enhancing glasses that connect directly to the wearer's visual cortex through their mesh implants. Give a boost to Perception.

### Nanotechnology

#### Healing Vats, High

Can be used to heal almost any wound or illness. Can also be used to install implants or bioware without requiring surgery or recovery.

Recovery in a healing vat depends on the needs of the story, but you can use the following times as guidelines:

* Healing from minor damage: few hours
* Healing from being hurt: 6 hours
* Healing from being severely hurt: 1-2 days
* Healing from being dead: 1 week

* Recovering from minor modification: 1 hour
* Recovering from a major modification: 12 hours
* Recovering extreme modification: 3 days

### Scavenger Tech

#### Mobile Lab, Moderate

A handheld device with different types of sensors. Gives a boost in Chemistry.

### Services

#### Anonymous Accounts, Moderate

Discreet online accounts that are hard to track.

#### Backup, Moderate

One-time backup of your ego.

#### Backup Insurance (per month), Low to Moderate

Services that guarantee either acquiring the cortical stack from a dead morph, or if that is impossible or difficult through legal channels, backup from an earlier ego. Price depends on the individual: the more dangerous life an individual lives, the more costly the insurance.

#### Body Bank (per month), Moderate

Cost for keeping a body in storage.

#### Bot/Pod Rental (per day), Moderate

Renting a helper bot/pod.

#### Egocasting, Expensive

Using a farcaster to transfer an ego to another habitat.

#### Fake Ego ID, High

A forged ID that will pass most system security.

#### Morph Brokerage, see chapter Morphs

Buying new morphs.

#### Psychosurgery (per month), Moderate

Use of an high-fidelity simulspace with psychosurgeon AI.

#### Simulspace Subscription, Low (day) / Moderate (monthly)

Access to a simulspace of your choice.

#### Space Travel, High / Expensive

Intra-habitat shuttle trip within the same cluster or from a planetary body's surface to orbit costs High. Everything else is Expensive.

### Software

#### Programs

Programs are created for some particular purpose in mind, be it scanning images or exploiting vulnerabilities. Most users have all the common programs needed for everyday mesh use. Programs of Low cost are required to perform advanced analytics, tracking or advanced encryption.

Programs of Moderate cost give a pool of 2 points in a General Ability like Infosec or 1 point in some Investigative skill like Engineering, for some particular purpose, like intruding on a system, tracking a user, or analysing a space stations plans for possible covert entrances.

Programs of High cost give a pool of 4 points in a General Ability or 2 point in some Investigative skill.

#### AI's and Muses, Moderate to Expensive

**Standard muses** (High cost) work as assistants, providing reminders, research and help with communications.

**Vehicle and device AI** (High and Moderate cost) perform services appropriate for the vehicle or device. They usually don't have pools that could be used in Ability tests, but may test the appropriate Ability if no transhuman pilot is available. (Note that most routine operations, like docking a shuttle, don't need tests.)

More specialized AI and muses are also available, usually for Expensive cost. They have a pool of 4 in some General Ability or 1 point in a Investigative Ability, which they may use independently.
 
### Survival Gear

#### Nanobandage, Trivial

Stabilizes a seriously wounded character so that they no longer lose Health.

#### Vacuum Suits

Most vacuum suits are skin-tight garments that use
the pressure of their advanced smartfabrics on the
wearer’s body to resist vacuum. When the wearer is in
a breathable atmosphere, the smartfabric also loosens
the suits to serve as ordinary clothing or be easily
put on or taken off. In all cases, the suits can become
skin-tight within 3 Action Turns. All vacsuits contain
advanced rebreather units capable of maintaining a
breathable atmosphere for several hours or days.

**Light Vacsuit, Low:** All models include a lightweight belt or torc
containing a miniature oxygen tank and advanced rebreather unit 
that provides 3 hours of air. 1 armor against shooting and melee combat. Instantly self-seal, unless the damage is enough to make the target hurt.

**Standard Vacsuit, Moderate:** hey are fitted with more substantial life
support belts that includes a maker capable of recycling all wastes and producing air for up to 48 hours and food and water indefinitely. 2 armor against shooting and 1 armor against melee combat. Instantly self-seal, unless the damage is enough to make the target hurt.

**Hardsuit, High:** Hardsuits look like large metallic ovals with 
jointed arms and legs. A built-in high-quality maker 
produces sufficient food, air, and water for a user to remain
in a hardsuit indefinitely. Their gloves incorporate smart materials that
allow each hand to use the equivalent of a utilitool. 
Hardsuits also contain radios and sensors equivalent to
those on standard vacsuits. 2 armor against shooting and melee combat. These suits
are maintained by a fixer nanoswarm, are instantly self-sealing
of any breach unless the damage is enough to make the target seriously wounded.

## Psi

Psi Sleights don’t work against synthmorphs, bots or vehicles.
The difficulty to affect pods is 2 higher and using Psi in place
for Investigative Abilities to affect pods costs 1 point more.

Characters can only use Psi if they
are in a biological morph. Characters in pods may use Psi, but
the Difficulty of tests is 2 higher and using Psi for Investigative
Abilities costs 1 point more.

Affecting a target with psi requires touching them.

Characters with Psi abilities are more susceptible to trauma
and exsurgent viruses. Add 1 to any Stability loss after an unsuccessful
Stability roll. The difficulty of all tests to resists exsurgent
viruses is 2 higher for them.

## Regaining Pool Points

Spent points from various pools are restored at different rates,
depending on their narrative purpose.

Investigative and Networking ability pools and Resources are
restored only at the end of each case, without regard to the amount
of time that passes in the game world. Players seeking to marshal
their resources may ask you how long cases typically run, in real
time. Most groups finish scenarios over 2-3 sessions. Players
may revise their sense of how carefully to manage point spending
as they see how quickly their group typically disposes of its
cases.

(GMs running extremely long, multi-part investigations may
designate certain story events as breakpoints where all investigative
pools are refreshed. For example, a planet-hopping investigation
where the team meets a separate team of enemies in five different
locales might allow refreshment of investigative pools after
each group of enemies is neutralized.)

Use of the Psychosurgery ability permits limited recovery of
Stability points in the course of an episode. Full refreshment
occurs between cases. It is possible only when the character
is able to spend calm, undisturbed quality time with friends
and loved ones uninvolved in the shadowy world of the Firewall.
In campaigns where the teammates’ personal lives are a matter
of background detail only, refreshment automatically occurs
between episodes.

GMs who wish to add a soap opera element to their campaigns, in
which the characters must balance the everyday pressures of
ordinary life against their activities as covert operatives,
can complicate this process. In this campaign type, the characters
must work to keep their support networks intact. If they fail,
they regain no Stability between episodes. As part of the character
creation process, players must detail their network of friends
and loved ones in a paragraph or two of background text, which
is then submitted to the GM for approval.

Following Motivations restores Stability. Whenever a character
makes significant progress in pursuing their Motivation, they
regain 1 point of Stability.

The Health pool refreshes over time,
at a rate of 2 points per day of restful activity. (Wounded characters
heal at a different rate, over a period of hospitalization.)
Use of the Medic ability can restore a limited number of Health
points in the course of a session.

Players may restore 3 General Ability pools to full whenever
they spend a few hours resting in a safe place. They don’t get to
restore the pools if they get ambushed, attacked or harassed
while resting.

> ### What Do Pool Points Represent?

> Pool points are a literary abstraction, representing the way
that each character gets his or her own time in the spotlight in
the course of an ensemble drama. When you do something remarkable,
you expend a little bit of your spotlight time. More active players
will spend their points sooner than less demonstrative ones,
unless they carefully pick and choose their moments to shine.

> Remember, all characters are remarkably competent. Pool points
measure your opportunities to exercise this ultra-competence
during any given scenario. Even when pools are empty, you still
have a reasonable chance to succeed at a test, and you’ll always
get the information you need to move forward in the case.

> Pool points do not represent a resource, tangible or otherwise,
in the game world. Players are aware of them, but characters are
not. The team members’ ignorance of them is analogous to TV characters’
obliviousness to commercial breaks, the unwritten rules of
scene construction, and the tendency of events to heat up during
sweeps.

> We represent this most purely in the case of investigative skills,
which are the core of the game. Their refreshment is tied to a purely
fictional construct, the length of the episode.

> However, where a pool could be seen to correspond to a resource
perceptible to the characters, we handle refreshment in a somewhat
more realistic, if also abstract, manner. Characters’ ebbing
Health scores are perceptible to the characters in the form of
welts, cuts, pain, and general fatigue. Stability is less tangible
but can be subjectively measured in the characters’ moods and
reactions. Physical abilities, also tied to fatigue and sharpness
of reflexes, are also handled with a nod to the demands of realism.

## Improving Your Character

At the end of each investigation, each player gets 2 build points
for each session they participated in. (This assumes a small
number of 3-4 hour sessions; if you play in shorter bursts, modify
accordingly.) Players who had characters die in the course of
the investigation only get points for each session involving
their current character.

These build points can be spent to increase
either investigative or general abilities. You may acquire
new abilities or bolster existing ones. If necessary to preserve
credibility, rationalize new abilities as areas of expertise
you’ve had all along, but are only revealing later in the series.

## Opponent Statistics

You usually only need game statistics for characters, including
ODEs, that the investigators in some way have to overcome through
general abilities. Most witnesses, suspects and non-combatants
require only a text description, indicating for example which
interpersonal abilities they’re most likely to respond to.

Opponents use the same Hit Threshold and Weapon Damage rules
as player characters.

When choosing Health ratings for dramatically unimportant
foes, don’t worry about simulating their relative robustness
in comparison to the general population. Focus on how many hits
they ought to be able to take before dropping, according to dramatic
logic. If you want a thug who falls to a single burst of automatic
fire, give him a Health of 1 or 2.

An Attack Pattern is an optional game statistic suggesting how
the opponent might spend its Melee Combat and/or Shooting points
from round to round of a fight. GMs should always consult story
logic and dramatic needs first and resort to the attack pattern
second. You might want a vast lumbering creature to smash doors
and walls around the PCs, and a small vicious ODE to attack with
unerring precision. These numbers are a fallback if you can’t
decide how the opponent would spend, or are uncomfortable choosing
to spend enough to guarantee a hit each time. Don’t use them just
because they’re there, even if you find the pull of numbers—oh,
sweet, beautiful numbers—generally irresistible.

When you do use the Attack Pattern, increase the spends after
each miss until the opponent either starts to hit, or runs out
of points. Once engaged, opponents figure out how hard the PCs
are to hit, and adjust their efforts accordingly.

Armor is subtracted from each instance of damage the opponent
takes. Where a weapon or weapons is listed in brackets after the
number, the Armor reduces damage only from those weapons. Some
Armor may protect against all Melee Combat attacks but not Shooting
attacks, or vice versa.

An opponent’s Alertness Modifier represents its ability to
sense your activities, whether through standard senses like
sight and hearing, or exotic ones like echolocation, pheromone
recognition, or energy signature reading. When you try to sneak
past it, the Alertness Modifier is applied to your base Infiltration
Difficulty, which is usually 4. It also applies to Infiltration
tests when you’re trying to observe the opponent without being
observed in turn. The Alertness Modifier reflects all of the
individual’s sensing capabilities, both natural and technological.
A second  number appearing after a slash
represents the opponent’s Alertness if its gear is somehow neutralized
or taken away.

An opponent with a Stealth Modifier is either significantly
harder or easier to spot with Sense Trouble. It alters the difficulty
number for that or similar tests.

### Opponents and NPC's
These stats are not supposed to represent important NPC's, but should be used for faceless and nameless NPC's that are encountered on the way.

## Tests and Supporting Characters

Game statistics in GUMSHOE are, whenever possible, player-facing.
When you as GM have the choice between making a determination
based on a player test, or on a test made by you on behalf of a supporting
character, always choose the player. For example, you may want
to specify that there’s a chance a harried relative of a kidnapping
victim might eventually lose her patience with the investigators
and participate in a damaging press conference. Rather than
having her make a Stability test to see when and if this happens,
set it up so that a player makes a Reassurance spend to forestall
her.

Likewise, if you want to have a supporting character steal something
in a situation where the PCs are in no position to affect the outcome,
simply decree that it happens. Don’t bother testing the character’s
Filch ability. To do otherwise is to engage in false branching:
you are creating unpredictability for yourself in a way that
remains invisible to the players. They don’t get a chance to alter
the outcome, and thus gain no benefit from the uncertainty you’ve
introduced.
