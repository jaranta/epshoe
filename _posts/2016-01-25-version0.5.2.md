title: Version 0.5.2. update and campaign on the way
---

There have been several updates to the rules. The version number is now 0.5.2. More playtesting is still needed, which is why the development has stalled for some time now. I'm writing a campaign, which I will use to test out the rules, and see what needs fixing. It's unlikely that the main pdf will be updated while I'm doing that, but in the meantime you are free to test it out yourself!
