# The Exsurgent Virus

The exsurgent virus is unlike anything that transhumanity has ever encountered. While it bears
similarities to both computer and biological viruses in
regards to infection of hosts and propagation, it is not
bound by many limits of form or transmission vector.

The exsurgent virus is amazingly effective and infectious. As an information virus, it is highly intelligent
and adaptive, able to mutate into new forms. Much like
certain viruses are able to cross species boundaries or
change their vector from contact to airborne, it is also a
self-morphing omnivirus, capable of altering itself and
its transmission vectors to bypass infection safeguards.

While it began as a digital computer virus -- the manner in which it infected the TITANs -- it has transformed to be communicable via at least three other forms: biological nanovirus, nanoplague, and basilisk hack. Each is described below, along with rules for infection and defense.

What exactly happens to infected characters depends on the strain of the Exsurgent virus in question. Almost without exception, the result is very unpleasant. The most positive outcome is getting infected with the Watts-MacLeod strain, which leads to psi powers -- and mental health problems. Usually, the result is much worse.

## Digital Infection

Test against the infection if running on the same system as the digital virus. Points can be used from both Sense Trouble and Stability. The Difficulty ranges from 4 to 10 (you can roll d6 + 3 to get a random difficulty). Do not tell the difficulty to the player!

If the player wins, nothing happens (this time). If the player loses but rolls 4 or more, they are aware that they are being taken over. If they tie, they can spend 1 point from Sense Trouble or Stability to win the contest. Otherwise, they are infected.

Infected characters will become corrupted by the virus in 10 rounds, minus the number of rounds they lost the test with.

Infected AI's and infomorphs can reboot to fight the infection. It takes them 1 round to shut down and 3 rounds to boot back up. After that they test again, with the same rules. If they lose this test, the virus managed to embed itself in their code before shutdown and they are infected.

Infected AI's, infomorphs and cyberbrains lose 1 Stability per hour.

## Biological Nanovirus

Characters become physically infected by exchanging bodily fluids or by being exposed to nanobots from a hive. In some cases characters may test Athletics to avoid splattering blood etc.

Characters should receive a Sense Trouble test to avoid touching infected biological material if they are in any way cautious or aware of the infection risk.

## Basilisk Hacks

Basilisk hacks are a way of hacking
transhuman brains merely by feeding them a specific
sample of sensory input, usually images or sounds. The
widespread use of augmented reality makes deployment of such hacks an easy matter; the exsurgent virus
just hacks into the target’s ecto or mesh inserts and
engages the sensory feed. More traditional methods
may also be used, including standard interactive video,
holograms, audio, subsonics, or even VR.

When a character experiences a basilisk hack, they
must make a test using points from Sense Trouble. If this test
fails, their brain is susceptible to the hack, and they
immediately lose 4 Stability. Additionally,
one of the following effects applies. 

### Incapacitating Inputs

The duration for
each effect listed below is 1 full scene. Optionally,
the player may test each round to overcome the effect,
but the stress of doing so costs them 1 Stability per
try.

* Cataplexy: The victim loses control of their
body and immediately collapses. For the duration
their body will be non-responsive but they will be
aware and capable of mental actions. Mesh actions
and implant controls are also disabled, however.
* Catatonic Stupor: The character becomes
immobile and non-responsive. Though conscious,
they are mentally “not there” -- the basilisk hack
has effectively crashed their brain functions. They
will do absolutely nothing for the duration and
will not respond even if moved or attacked.
* Disorientation: The character becomes disoriented and severely confused. They are incapable
of making decisions, understanding communication, understanding what is going on around
them, or acting in any sort of determined way for
the duration.
* Grand Mal Seizures: The subject immediately falls to the ground and begins convulsing,
suffering d6 - 2 damage. They may do nothing
else for the duration and will suffer a period
of confusion and weakness (+1 Difficulty
to all actions) for one scene afterwards.
* Hallucinations: The character immediately
goes off on a mental trip, leaving them completely
disconnected from reality and their physical
body. For the duration, the character should only
respond to the hallucinated reality the gamemaster describes to them or else the character should
be treated as an NPC, run by the gamemaster.
* Impaired Cognition: The character’s mental
capabilities bottom out, turning them into a
disabled vegetable. The character cannot use Investigative Abilities, and the character should act accordingly to environmental stimuli.
* Nausea/Vertigo: The character is overcome
with head-spinning and vomiting and is effectively incapacitated for the duration.
* Sleep: The character passes out for the duration
and cannot be woken short of medical intervention.

### Sensory Reprogramming

In some cases, the exsurgent virus can actually reprogram the target’s mind via dedicated sensory input. This is a trickier affair, however, requiring uninterrupted programming time.

Only if the character is exposed to the sensory reprogramming for the whole scene without interruptions does it take effect. Like with the previous attack, the character may retry each round by paying the cost of 1 Stability.

If the reprogramming is stopped, the victim must test Stability or lose 4 Stability points due to the stress caused by the attack.

### YGBM Attacks

Rather than completely reprogramming a victim,
some exsurgent attacks simply plant subconscious
commands in the target’s mind, similar to posthypnotic suggestions. Nicknamed “You gotta believe me”
attacks, YGBMs are a sort of remote digital brain-washing attempt used to create sleeper terrorists and
unknowing collaborators, often by targeting them via
the mesh. 

If the character fails the test against the YGBM-attack, they have a subliminal command implanted in their mind without their knowledge. The suggestion stays for up to a week, and if the character encounters whatever trigger it is dependent on, they will act according to the suggestion as if it was their own idea. They may try a final test of Stability to resist the compulsion before submitting to it.

### Nanoplague

Exsurgent nanoswarms work like other nanoswarms, except they are capable of penetrating biomorphs internally. Any morph that comes into contact with a nanoplague is considered infected.

### Exsurgents

The following Exsurgents are taken from two Eclipse Phase scenarios, *Continuity* and *Glory*. They can be used as guidelines for making other Exsurgents. They fall within two distinct groups:

1. Humans infected with the Chrynalus virus eventually bloom into sharp, crystalline growths.
2. Humans infected with the Glory virus form packs that consist of one mother and several breeders and drones that serve and guard the mother.

### Chrynalus
