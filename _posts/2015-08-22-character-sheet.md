title: 'Updated Character Sheet'
---

I updated the character sheet. It now has space for morph attributes, equipment and a better way to keep track of health and stability.

It still has much to go, but using the new character sheet should make keeping track of the character much easier. If you happen to like designing character sheets, you're free to take a shot at tweaking it. The Inkscape-file is in the repository.
