title: 'New, form fillable character sheet'
---
I've been busy with Stuff, but I managed to run a game of EclipseSHOE for two new groups of players. I used the current rules, but because the games were run in a convention, there wasn't much time for character creation. I had to create a bunch of premade characters, which was a real pain with the character sheet I'd used previously. I decided that it would be easier to just make a form fillable character sheet, so I could type or copy-paste the necessary information into the sheets. It is far from perfect, but worked for my purposes. The new Scribus format should be fairly straightforward to fix in the future too.

The new sheet is available in the repository, so if you download the current version of the game, it is included there.
