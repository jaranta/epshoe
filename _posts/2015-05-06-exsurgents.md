title: 'Rules for the Exsurgent Virus added'
---

The rules for Exsurgents are now available in the devel-branch. They will be in the 0.6 version of the pdf, but for now, you can take a look at the [file in the repository](https://github.com/jaranta/epshoe/blob/devel/core/exsurgents.md) and comment on what you think about the rules. Adding the rules for the Exsurgent Virus was one of the 4 milestones for the [next release](https://github.com/jaranta/epshoe/milestones/0.6), which means that there are only 3 to go until we get to version 0.6.
